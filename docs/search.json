He charts the progression of AI agent technology in three versions:\n\nV1: AI Automation: This phase, prominent about two years prior to the video, involved building tools for simple, single-use tasks like inbox management, content generation, and report creation. Devin argues these were more akin to automations with LLMs added rather than true, autonomous agents. There was friction in the developer community regarding the definition of an “agent” at this stage.\nV2: Vertical/Singular AI Agents: Inspired by the vertical SaaS model (software for specific industries, e.g., software for car dealerships), this stage involves creating specific AI agents for specific roles or tasks (e.g., an SDR agent, a customer support agent). While this is a current area of focus and business opportunity, Devin sees it as another step towards the ultimate goal, potentially limited by the anthropomorphizing of traditional roles. The focus should shift to the tasks involved rather than mapping directly to human job titles.\nV3: Agentic OS: Devin believes this is the next major phase, arriving potentially this year and next year. This is the step that brings us closer to the “omni-capable, omnipresent” AI vision.\n\nWhat is an Agentic Operating System?\nAn Agentic OS is defined as an agentic system that operates within a data sandbox. Key characteristics:\n\nData Sandbox: It has full, contextual, real-time access to the specific data it needs to operate.\nTools: It has access to the necessary tools to execute tasks and workflows.\nAutonomy: It can operate reliably, effectively, and autonomously, requiring less direct human guidance than previous versions.\n\nDevin argues that the technology to build Agentic OS is largely here, but the UI/UX for humans to effectively interact with, track, review, and provide human-in-the-loop guidance for these autonomous systems is still missing. He likens the need to the initial lack of a simple interface for early LLMs before ChatGPT popularized the chat format – the technology existed, but the accessible interface was needed for mass adoption. The ideal is a Jarvis-like personal AI.\nThe Future Vision: A Web of Agents\nDevin envisions a future structure:\n\nPersonal Agents: Every individual will have their own personal AI agent, much like having a smartphone today. This agent is trained on the individual’s personal data sandbox (conversations, emails, messages, health data, etc.) and acts as an extension or “second brain.” This personal agent serves as the primary interface to connect with the outside digital world.\nBusiness Agentic Operating Systems: Businesses will have a centralized Agentic OS operating within their proprietary data sandbox and workflows. Employees will interact with the business OS via their personal agents, with appropriate permissions.\nInterconnected Ecosystem: Personal agents and business AOs will connect to the internet, other agents/AOs, paywall data, tools, algorithms, and potentially even physical machines (robots). This creates a “web” of connected systems, possibly leveraging protocols like blockchain for secure data exchange and function execution. The AI/Agentic OS becomes the new digital “middleman.”\n\nHe draws an analogy to the smartphone: A smartphone holds our personal data (sandbox), provides communication (channel), connects us to external tools (apps, internet), and facilitates actions. Humans, with their pre-trained knowledge (memory, experience, skills), use the phone to interact with the world based on their “purpose” (their goals/prompts).\nWhat LLMs Need to Become True Agents:\nTo achieve the Agentic OS future, LLMs need:\n\nReal-time contextual data access.\nTooling capabilities to execute actions/workflows.\nMemory storage and core knowledge.\nFeedback mechanisms for continuous learning and adjustment.\nPurpose: This is the crucial element provided by humans, essentially the prompt or goal the agent needs to achieve.\n\nCurrent Bottlenecks: The path to this future faces challenges including data access, context window limitations, compute power, energy consumption, and geopolitical factors.\nHow to Get There: Requires:\n\nReal-time, contextual data integration.\nEnd-to-end system integration.\nStandardized data pipelines.\nRobust prompt engineering (though ideally models will need less).\nSimple, seamless orchestration of agents.\nNice-to-Haves: Better LLMs (like Gemini 1.5 Pro mentioned positively), improved context handling (exploring Graph RAG), and potentially a new internet protocol specifically designed for agents.\n\nDevin’s Work: Building Super Agents Today\nDevin’s company, CUSTOM AI STUDIO, is actively building these systems using a “Super Agent Architecture.” Their approach focuses on making the system scalable via natural language (prompts) rather than complex code. Key components they build:\n\nAgentic Database (formerly Master Database): A centralized data sandbox for the agent, built custom for clients (e.g., using Supabase for data storage, Pinecone for vector embeddings). It syncs unstructured data like emails and conversations to provide context (using RAG, exploring Graph RAG).\nComprehensive Tooling: End-to-end integration with external software/tools via APIs.\nPrompt Playbooks: Stored and managed in a structured way (e.g., in AirTable), containing the prompts, descriptions, and steps that define the agent’s capabilities.\n\nMallerie: An Executive Agent Example\nDevin demos “Mallerie,” their team’s Executive Agent, built using n8n for orchestration and AirTable for configuration/logging.\n\nComponents: Mallerie connects to an Agentic CRM (for contact info), an Agentic Database (for past conversations/context), and uses sub-agents/tools for Calendar actions, Email actions, and Slack messaging.\nWorkflow (Planned/Ideal): An input (like an email or Slack message) triggers a Routing Agent to read the input and descriptions of available prompts (the “Playbook”). Based on context (potentially pulled from CRM/DB), the Routing Agent selects the most relevant prompt from the Playbook. This selected prompt is then executed by the Super Agent (Mallerie) which accesses the necessary data and tools.\nDemo: Devin shows configuring prompts in AirTable. He then interacts with Mallerie via Slack, showing her pulling up meeting schedules, booking a meeting (demonstrating Calendar tool use), and sending an email to an external contact found in the CRM (demonstrating CRM and Email tool use).\nChallenges Highlighted: The demo subtly shows current UI/UX limitations (identifying users in Slack without mentioning, formatting issues in output, temporary memory buffer issue affecting context). The need for better observability (seeing the workflow run visually) is also mentioned.\n\nThe “Age of the Idea Guy”: Devin believes the increasing ease of building these systems (mentioning platforms like Lovable as impressive examples) means the value shifts towards having clear ideas and visions, as tools make execution more accessible. The interaction with agents will move from “building” to simply “communicating.”\nCommunity and Course Offering:\nDevin announces opening up his community with a new course.\n\nCourse Content: Covers foundational AI concepts (LLMs, agents, chatbots, etc.), technical building blocks (Vector Databases, RAG, APIs, data pipelines, prompt engineering), and critically, live builds of Super Agents.\nTeaching Style: Some modules are conceptual talks (like the video), while others (Super Agent builds) are screen recordings with voiceovers showing the step-by-step process using tools like n8n.\nPurpose: To educate others (from laymen to developers) on these concepts and practical building methods, making the complex accessible and showing the real-world application of agentic systems using standard tools. He uses departmental names (e.g., “Sales Super Agent”) to help people understand the potential applications, while emphasizing that the core difference between agents is primarily the prompt/playbook, data, and tools.\n\nConclusion:\nDevin concludes by reiterating his excitement for Agentic OS as the next leap, moving beyond simple AI automation and singular agents. He believes this future, where personal and business AIs operate autonomously within their data sandboxes and an interconnected web, holds the potential for massive productivity gains (1000x) and a transformation in how businesses operate and how individuals interact with the digital world, enabling a rapid transition from idea to execution."

    "section": "",
    "text": ":Model Instructions:\n\n:You: please summarize this video in detail\n\n\n\nDeep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, here is a detailed summary of Andrej Karpathy’s “Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT” video, covering the core concepts, stages, examples, and implications discussed over its 3.5-hour duration:\nOverall Goal: To provide a comprehensive, general-audience understanding of how Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT work, how they are built, their capabilities, limitations, and psychological implications.\nI. Stage 1: Pre-training - Building the Base Model (The Internet Simulator)\n\nData Collection & Processing:\n\nGoal: Gather vast amounts of high-quality, diverse text data, primarily from the public internet.\nSource: Often starts with massive crawls like Common Crawl (billions of pages).\nProcessing Pipeline (e.g., FineWeb dataset - 44TB, 15 Trillion Tokens):\n\nURL Filtering: Remove unwanted sites (malware, spam, adult, racist, etc.) using blocklists.\nText Extraction: Isolate the main textual content from raw HTML, removing navigation, boilerplate, code, ads.\nLanguage Filtering: Identify and select languages (e.g., FineWeb focuses heavily on English). This choice impacts the model’s multilingual capabilities.\nQuality Filtering: Apply heuristics or models to keep only high-quality text.\nDeduplication: Remove duplicate or near-duplicate documents.\nPII Removal: Attempt to identify and remove Personally Identifiable Information (addresses, SSNs).\n\nResult: A large corpus of cleaned text documents.\n\nTokenization:\n\nNeed: Neural networks operate on sequences of discrete symbols from a finite vocabulary. Raw text (characters or bytes) needs conversion.\nChallenge: Representing text efficiently. Using raw bytes (256 symbols) creates extremely long sequences. Using words creates a massive, open vocabulary.\nSolution: Byte Pair Encoding (BPE): An algorithm that starts with bytes (0-255) and iteratively merges the most frequent consecutive pairs into new symbols (tokens).\nOutcome: A vocabulary of common sub-word units (tokens). GPT-4 uses ~100k tokens. Text becomes a sequence of token IDs.\nExample (tiktokenizer): “hello world” might be two tokens [hello, _world]. Sensitivity to spaces, capitalization matters. “ubiquitous” might be [ub, iq, uitous].\nImplication: The model “sees” tokens, not characters, which affects tasks like spelling or character counting later.\n\nNeural Network Training (The Core Task):\n\nGoal: Train a neural network to predict the next token in a sequence, given the preceding tokens (the context).\nProcess:\n\nSample random windows (sequences of tokens) from the pre-training data (up to the model’s max context length, e.g., 1k for GPT-2, 100k+ now).\nFor each position in the window, feed the preceding tokens into the neural network.\nThe network outputs probabilities for every token in the vocabulary for the next position.\nCompare the predicted probabilities to the actual next token (the label).\nCalculate a “loss” (how wrong the prediction was).\nAdjust the network’s parameters (billions of “knobs” or weights) slightly using calculus (backpropagation and gradient descent) to make the correct token more probable next time.\n\nArchitecture: The Transformer: The standard architecture. It’s a stack of layers involving concepts like attention (allowing tokens to “look” at each other), feed-forward networks, etc. Karpathy emphasizes it’s a large but fixed mathematical expression transforming input tokens and parameters into output probabilities.\nCompute: This stage is extremely computationally expensive. Requires large clusters of powerful GPUs (like Nvidia H100s) running for weeks or months. This drives the high cost and the “GPU gold rush.” (Analogy: Trillions of operations just predicting next tokens).\nExample: GPT-2 (2019): 1.5B parameters, 1k context, ~100B tokens training data, cost ~$40k then, maybe ~$100 now due to hardware/software improvements. Karpathy shows a live training example, emphasizing watching the “loss” decrease.\n\nInference (Generating Text):\n\nOnce trained, the parameters are fixed.\nStart with a prompt (a sequence of tokens).\nFeed the prompt into the model to get probabilities for the next token.\nSample (don’t just pick the most likely) a token based on these probabilities (like flipping a biased coin). This introduces randomness/creativity.\nAppend the sampled token to the sequence.\nRepeat: feed the new, longer sequence back in to get the next token, sample, append…\nResult: A generated continuation of the prompt.\n\nThe Base Model:\n\nThe outcome of pre-training is a “base model.”\nIt’s essentially an “internet document simulator” or a “token simulator.” Given a prompt, it autocompletes with statistically likely text similar to its training data.\nIt’s not inherently an assistant. Asking “What is 2+2?” might result in it continuing with more questions found online, not answering “4”.\nKnowledge: Contains vast knowledge implicitly stored in its parameters (a “lossy compression” of the internet). This knowledge is a “vague recollection.”\nCapabilities: Can be prompted cleverly (e.g., few-shot learning like the English-Korean translation example) or by structuring the prompt like a chat transcript to simulate an assistant. Can show memorization (regurgitation) of common data like Wikipedia pages. Can “hallucinate” plausible continuations for prompts about unknown future events (e.g., 2024 election outcome).\nExample: Playing with the Llama 3.1 405B base model on Hyperbolic.\n\n\nII. Stage 2: Post-training - Creating an Assistant\n\nGoal: Take the knowledgeable base model and make it a helpful, harmless, honest assistant that follows instructions and engages in conversation. This stage is computationally much cheaper than pre-training.\n\n\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):\n\nAnalogy: Learning from worked examples in a textbook.\nData: Create a dataset of high-quality conversations (human prompts + ideal assistant responses).\n\nInitially (InstructGPT): Humans wrote prompts and ideal responses based on detailed instructions (be helpful, harmless, truthful).\nModern: Often uses LLMs to help generate/draft responses, which humans then edit/curate (synthetic data + human oversight). Examples: OpenAssistant dataset, UltraChat.\n\nConversation Formatting: Conversations need to be tokenized, using special tokens to denote turns (e.g., GPT-4o’s &lt;|im_start|&gt; user, &lt;|im_start|&gt; assistant, &lt;|im_end|&gt;).\nProcess: Continue training the base model, but only on this new conversation dataset (using the same next-token prediction objective).\nResult: The model learns the style and persona of the desired assistant. It learns to answer questions, refuse harmful requests, etc., by imitating the examples.\nWhat you’re talking to: Karpathy suggests thinking of the SFT model as a statistical simulation of the average human labeler following the company’s instructions. It’s not a general AI, but an imitator of curated human behavioral examples.\n\nLLM Psychology & Limitations (Emerging from Training & Architecture):\n\nHallucinations: Making things up.\n\nCause: The model imitates the confident style of answers in its training data, even when it lacks knowledge. It defaults to statistically plausible completions rather than admitting ignorance.\nMitigation 1 (Data): Identify questions the base model doesn’t know (by probing it and checking answers against facts) and add examples to the SFT data where the correct response is “I don’t know.” This teaches the model to associate internal uncertainty signals with verbal refusal.\nMitigation 2 (Tool Use): Teach the model to use tools like web search or a code interpreter.\n\nMechanism: Introduce special tokens for tool calls (e.g., &lt;|search_start|&gt; query &lt;|search_end|&gt;). Train on examples showing when and how to use tools. When the model emits the end token, the system pauses, runs the tool (e.g., performs a web search), pastes the results back into the context.\nContext Window as Working Memory: Information in the context window (prompt + generation history + tool results) is directly accessible, like human working memory. Information in parameters is vague recollection. Giving the model info in the context (like pasting a chapter to summarize) yields better results than relying on memory.\n\n\nNeed Tokens to Think:\n\nCause: Each token generation step involves a fixed, finite amount of computation (one forward pass through the network). Complex reasoning cannot happen “instantaneously” for a single token.\nImplication: Models need to “spread out” their reasoning across multiple token generation steps. Intermediate calculations or steps need to be generated as tokens.\nExample: The math problem (Emily’s apples/oranges). Directly asking for the answer in one token fails for harder numbers. Showing step-by-step reasoning works. This is why chat models often produce verbose, step-by-step solutions – it’s for them as much as for the user.\nTool Use Benefit: Offloading computation (like arithmetic to a code interpreter) is more reliable than the model’s “mental arithmetic.”\n\nOther Quirks:\n\nCounting/Spelling: Often poor due to tokenization (model doesn’t “see” characters easily) combined with the “mental arithmetic” difficulty of counting. Asking for code often helps. (Example: Dots counting, strawberry ’R’s, ubiquitous third letters).\nKnowledge of Self: Models don’t inherently know “who” they are. Answers like “I am ChatGPT by OpenAI” are often hallucinations based on internet prevalence unless explicitly programmed via SFT data (like AllenAI’s Olmo) or system prompts.\nSwiss Cheese Capabilities: Models can be brilliant at complex tasks (PhD physics) yet fail simple ones (9.11 vs 9.9 comparison, potentially due to interference from unrelated patterns like Bible verses). Requires caution and verification.\n\n\nReinforcement Learning (RL): The Third Stage\n\nAnalogy: Practice problems in a textbook where you know the final answer but have to find the solution method yourself.\nMotivation: SFT teaches imitation, but humans aren’t always perfect examples, and their reasoning process might not be optimal for the LLM. RL allows the model to discover the most effective problem-solving strategies for itself.\nRL for Verifiable Domains (Math, Code):\n\nProcess:\n\nGive the model a prompt (e.g., a math problem).\nHave the model generate many candidate solutions (rollouts) using sampling.\nAutomatically check which solutions reach the correct final answer (e.g., checking the number in a marked box).\nReinforce (increase the probability of) the token sequences that led to correct answers. Often, train specifically on the “best” correct solution found (e.g., shortest, most efficient).\n\nDeepSeek RL Paper: A key paper showing this massively improves reasoning. Models learn to “think” - producing longer responses with self-correction, backtracking, exploring multiple angles (“wait let me recheck this”). This is emergent, not explicitly taught.\nThinking Models: Models trained this way (DeepSeek R1, GPT-4 O-series, Gemini 2 Thinking). Often show a “Reasoning” step. OpenAI hides the full chain-of-thought, DeepSeek shows it. These models excel at hard reasoning tasks but might be overkill for simple queries.\nConnection to AlphaGo: Just like AlphaGo RL surpassed human imitation (Supervised Learning) in Go and found novel moves (Move 37), RL for LLMs could potentially discover superhuman reasoning strategies, though this is nascent.\n\nRLHF (RL from Human Feedback) for Unverifiable Domains (Creativity, Style):\n\nProblem: How to score outputs like jokes or poems automatically when there’s no single “correct” answer? Human evaluation is needed but doesn’t scale to billions of examples needed for RL.\nSolution (InstructGPT/Anthropic pioneers):\n\nCollect human preference data: Show humans multiple model outputs for a prompt (e.g., 5 jokes) and ask them to rank them best to worst. (Ranking is easier than absolute scoring).\nTrain a separate neural network (the Reward Model) to predict the human preference score/ranking given a prompt and a completion.\nUse this trained Reward Model as an automatic scorer in the RL loop. The LLM generates outputs, the reward model scores them, and the LLM is trained to maximize the reward model’s score.\n\nUpside: Allows applying RL principles to subjective domains. Often improves quality because discriminating good outputs is easier for humans than generating perfect ones from scratch (discriminator-generator gap).\nDownside (Crucial): The reward model is just a simulation of human preference and can be gamed. RL is very good at finding “adversarial examples” - nonsensical outputs (like “the the the the”) that trick the reward model into giving a high score. Therefore, you can’t run RLHF indefinitely; quality improves initially then collapses as the model learns to exploit the reward model. It’s more like a final fine-tuning step than “true” scalable RL. Karpathy: “RLHF is not RL” (in the magical, scalable sense).\n\n\n\nIII. Summary of Training Pipeline & Analogy\n\nPre-training: Reading all the textbook exposition (builds knowledge base -&gt; Base Model).\nSFT: Studying worked expert solutions (learns style/persona by imitation -&gt; Assistant Model).\nRL: Doing practice problems (discovers effective problem-solving strategies -&gt; Reasoning/Thinking Model).\n(RLHF): A limited form of RL for subjective tasks using a human preference simulator (fine-tunes the assistant).\n\nIV. Future Trends\n\nMultimodality: Models handling text, audio (hearing/speaking), images (seeing/painting) natively within one framework (often by tokenizing other modalities).\nAgents: Models performing longer sequences of tasks autonomously with error correction and supervision (human-to-agent ratios).\nPervasiveness & Invisibility: Integration into existing tools, maybe OS-level actions (like OpenAI’s Operator concept).\nResearch Frontiers: E.g., Test-Time Training (models learning continuously after deployment, beyond just in-context learning), handling extremely long contexts beyond current window limits.\n\nV. Resources & Finding Models\n\nStaying Updated: LLM Arena leaderboard (human preferences), AI News newsletter (comprehensive), X/Twitter (community).\nUsing Models:\n\nProprietary: Provider websites (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude).\nOpen Weights (Llama, DeepSeek, Mistral): Inference providers (Together.ai, Hugging Face), potentially local running (LM Studio, Ollama) for smaller/quantized versions.\nBase Models: Harder to find hosted, Hyperbolic is one place for Llama 3.1 base.\n\n\nVI. Conclusion - What is ChatGPT?\nWhen you type into ChatGPT:\n\nYour query is tokenized and added to the conversation context using a specific format.\nThis token sequence feeds into a massive, pre-trained Transformer network with fixed parameters.\nThe network generates the next token by sampling from output probabilities. This repeats.\nThe content and style of the response are primarily shaped by the SFT stage - it’s simulating a human labeler following OpenAI’s guidelines, based on millions of examples.\nIf using a “Thinking” model (like GPT-4o Advanced Reasoning), the RL stage has further refined its problem-solving approach by letting it practice and discover effective reasoning steps, potentially beyond simple human imitation for verifiable tasks.\nIt remains a statistical system with quirks and limitations (hallucinations, “Swiss cheese” capabilities). Use it as a powerful tool, verify its output, and understand it’s fundamentally a sophisticated pattern-matching and sequence-completion machine, not a conscious entity."

    "text": ":Model Instructions:\n\n:You: please summarize this video in detail\n\n\n\nHow to Become The Go-To Expert in the AI Content Storm!\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, here’s a detailed summary of the YouTube video “How to Become The Go-To Expert in the AI Content Storm!” by James Medoo from AI Learning Communities:\nCore Problem: The AI Content Storm\n\nThe speaker, James Medoo, identifies a massive influx of AI-generated content, calling it an “AI content storm.”\nThis is driven by the ease with which anyone can now create content using AI tools, leveling the playing field.\nThis “storm” is happening much faster than previous tech cycles (e.g., the rush to PDFs/ebooks in the early 2000s, then online courses in the mid-2010s). AI developments are daily.\nConsequences of the storm:\n\nDevaluation of generic content: If AI can create it easily, its inherent value decreases.\nDifficulty in finding accurate/authentic content: AI can produce varied answers from similar prompts, making it hard to discern quality and originality.\nChallenge to human-created content: The value of traditional ebooks or courses is questioned when AI can generate similar information.\n\nThis storm is not temporary; businesses must adapt.\n\nThe Solution: An AI-Powered Personally Branded Campus\nMedoo argues that competing solely on content is a losing battle. Instead, education businesses should build an “AI-powered personally branded campus” (also referred to as an AI learning community). This isn’t about quick “get rich” schemes with AI (like building micro-SaaS tools) but about building a sustainable, long-term education business.\nWhy a Personally Branded Campus Works (What AI Can’t Replace):\nAI can create content, but it’s missing crucial human elements:\n\nTrust in a real person: Genuine one-on-one or small-group interaction cannot be replicated by chatbots.\nShared experiences: AI cannot (currently) create the experience of learning and interacting with others.\nCommunity: The archive and ongoing interactions within a human community are unique.\n\nThe 5 C’s of a Successful Personally Branded Campus:\nTo stand out, individuals/businesses should focus on:\n\nCurate: Filter the vast amount of AI-generated and other content, selecting what’s most appropriate for your audience’s specific outcomes.\nContext: Explain why certain approaches work in specific situations. This leverages your experience and expertise. AI-generated content often lacks this nuanced, personalized context.\nCommunity: Foster a space where students connect with each other, not just the content. They share applications, implementations, and support.\nCredibility: Your personal experience (having “lived it” or “done it”) validates the content you share. This builds trust.\nCare: Provide genuine support for people, moving beyond aggressive marketing tactics. This human touch is something AI cannot offer.\n\nPractical Structure of a Personally Branded Campus:\nMedoo suggests specific components for such a campus:\n\nLive Q&A: Regular sessions for real-time interaction and problem-solving.\nForums, Groups, Spaces: Dedicated areas for discussions, sharing wins, and asking questions (preferably on your own platform, not third-party ones like Facebook).\nShowcases: A place for members to share their work and get feedback from real people.\nEvolving Curriculum: Crucial in the fast-paced AI world. Static courses quickly become outdated. The curriculum must be flexible, focusing on strategies and adapting applications as the landscape changes.\nPersonalized Feedback: Direct, human feedback is invaluable.\nLive Events/Classes: Medoo emphasizes this as a core of his own business (e.g., daily check-ins, weekly workshops).\nChallenges & Gamification: To engage members and provide structured outcomes.\nFocus on Education (Campus vs. Community): Medoo distinguishes a “campus” from a generic “community” by its emphasis on structured outcomes and a strong investment in education, rather than just informal sharing.\n\nPositioning Yourself with a Personally Branded Campus:\n\nEnhance, Don’t Replace: Use AI tools as digital assistants to automate tasks you don’t enjoy (e.g., content repurposing, social media posting), freeing you up for valuable human interaction.\nStrategic Tool Use: Learn when to use AI tools and where your human expertise remains critical. There are thousands of AI tools; discernment is key.\nBuild Skills Around AI: Develop skills that complement AI rather than being replaced by it.\n\nDefining a Personally Branded Campus (Key Characteristics):\n\nAuthentic Voice: Your unique writing style, speaking patterns, and expressions should drive all content and communication. This is recognizable and cannot be faked by AI.\nUnique Process/Philosophy: Your distinct teaching framework or viewpoint should be woven through all content.\nSpecific Expertise: Your focused area of knowledge becomes your signature, associated directly with you/your brand.\nVisual Identity: Consistent branding (colors, fonts, thumbnails) across all touchpoints to build recognition.\n\nExample of AI Integration:\nMedoo gives an example of his own workflow: * A YouTube video is created. * AI automatically transcribes it, rewrites it with key points/summaries, and posts it as a tutorial on his WordPress site (his personally branded campus). * Another AI tool then automatically posts this content to LinkedIn, Facebook, etc., maintaining a consistent style.\nCall to Action:\nMedoo invites viewers to learn more and join his personally branded campus at trainings.io/join, where he offers his content, prompts, live classes, and workshops to help people start, build, and grow their own education businesses.\nIn essence, the video advises education entrepreneurs to leverage AI for content creation and automation but to build their business around the irreplaceable human elements of trust, community, curated expertise, personalized context, and genuine care, all housed within their own “personally branded campus.”"

    "text": ":Model Instructions:\n\n:You: Fassen bitte dieses Video ausführlich zusammen, auch mit fakten die genannt werden\n\n\n\nDIESES Video muss JETZT jeder Anleger sehen: So handelt Andreas Beck in der Krise!\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, hier ist eine ausführliche Zusammenfassung des Gesprächs zwischen Mario Lochner und Andreas Beck, einschließlich der genannten Fakten:\nKontext und Hauptthema: Das Video ist ein Interview mit dem Portfolioexperten und Mathematiker Andreas Beck, geführt von Mario Lochner. Es findet inmitten einer Phase starker Marktturbulenzen statt, die offenbar durch politische Ankündigungen nach der US-Wahl (implizit Donald Trump betreffend) ausgelöst wurden. Das Hauptthema ist die Einordnung der aktuellen Situation, wie Andreas Beck darauf reagiert und welche Handlungsempfehlungen er für Privatanleger hat. Lochner bezeichnet das Video als potenziell das wichtigste für Privatanleger in der aktuellen Phase.\nEinschätzung der aktuellen Marktlage:\n\nKrise/Crash/Regimewechsel: Beck bestätigt klar:\n\nJa, es ist eine Krise.\nJa, es ist ein “Regimewechsel” im Marktverhalten (seit Montagmorgen).\nJa, es ist ein Crash (wesentliche Märkte &gt;20% im Minus, was die Definition eines Bärenmarktes erfüllt).\n\nMarktindikatoren:\n\nVolatilität (VIX): Der VIX ist extrem stark angestiegen, zeitweise über 50. Beck nennt einen Schwellwert von 40 als Grenze zu irrationalen Niveaus. Das aktuelle Niveau sei “Panik”, vergleichbar mit Corona-Höchstständen und über dem Niveau zu Beginn des Ukraine-Krieges.\nUnternehmensanleihen: Die Risikoaufschläge (Spreads) von Unternehmensanleihen gegenüber sicheren Staatsanleihen sind ebenfalls gestiegen (genannter Wert im Beispiel: 1,5% bzw. 150 Basispunkte). Beck hätte in einer “echten” Krise eher 1,8% erwartet. Die Reaktion ist hier aber gedämpfter als bei Aktien.\n\nUrsache der Krise:\n\nBeck sieht keinen externen Schock wie bei Corona (Virus, Lockdowns) oder dem Ukraine-Krieg (Energieversorgung), bei dem die Lösung unklar war.\nDie aktuelle Krise sei hausgemacht und politisch motiviert (durch Trumps Ankündigungen, insbesondere bezüglich Zöllen).\nEinzigartigkeit: Jeder kenne die Lösung (ein politischer Kompromiss, ein “Tweet”) und wisse im Grunde, dass Trumps Maximalforderungen “nicht gehen”, also praktisch nicht umsetzbar sind.\n\n\nAndreas Becks Analyse und Strategie:\n\nUnpraktikabilität der Trump-Pläne:\n\nBeck argumentiert, dass die radikalen Änderungen, die Trump vorschlägt (z.B. Zerschlagung etablierter Lieferketten wie bei Apple), unrealistisch sind. Unternehmen würden nicht kurzfristig langjährige Beziehungen und Produktionsstrukturen aufgeben für eine Politik, die sich schnell ändern kann (spätestens mit den nächsten Wahlen 2026).\nDie US-Wirtschaft und Wähler seien sehr sensibel für ökonomische Störungen. Ein langes Festhalten an der aktuellen disruptiven Politik sei unwahrscheinlich. Trump sei ein “Dealmaker”, kein “Antikapitalist”, der die Wirtschaft ruinieren wolle.\n\nVerhalten der Marktteilnehmer:\n\nDer massive Verkaufsdruck komme nicht primär von panischen Privatanlegern (diese kauften teilweise eher), sondern von institutionellen Akteuren wie Hedgefonds, die aufgrund von Hebelwirkung und Risikomanagement-Systemen (Margin Calls) verkaufen müssen, nicht wollen. Dieser Punkt sei am Freitagabend/Montagmorgen erreicht worden.\n\n“Eigenkapitalknappheit” als Chance: Beck bezeichnet die Situation als “Eigenkapitalknappheit”: Unternehmen bekommen schwerer Kapital, die Kurse sind niedrig. Wer Liquidität hat (wie Becks Fonds), kann dies nutzen, um günstig zu kaufen.\nKonkrete Portfolio-Anpassungen (Global Portfolio One als Beispiel):\n\nAktienquote erhöht: Die Aktienquote wurde von ca. 77% (durch Kursverluste gesunken) wieder deutlich in Richtung Zielquote (über 80%, im Beispiel genannt ca. 90% Ziel nach Umschichtung) erhöht. Es wurden 13% der Reserven investiert, nicht nur 10% (durch Rebalancing-Effekt).\nRegionale Anpassung:\n\nNordamerika: Relativ stärker gewichtet, da stärker gefallen.\nEuropa: Ebenfalls aufgestockt.\nSchwellenländer: Anteil (implizit) reduziert bzw. vorerst in Europa “geparkt”. Grund: Das China-Risiko wird als höher und persistenter eingeschätzt.\n\nAuflösung der Investitionsreserve: Um die Aktienkäufe zu finanzieren, wurden Teile der Reserve verkauft:\n\nSchweizer Franken Anleihen: Wurden nahezu komplett verkauft (von ca. 10% auf 0,7%). Diese hätten ihre Funktion als sicherer Hafen gut erfüllt (stabile Währung, Nachfrage trieb kurzfristige Zinsen teils wieder ins Negative), waren sehr gefragt und konnten mit Gewinn verkauft werden.\nUS-Dollar Anleihen: Wurden komplett verkauft (von ca. 6,5% auf 0,0%). Begründung: Der US-Dollar funktionierte in dieser Krise nicht als sicherer Hafen wie sonst oft. Das Risiko wurde als zu hoch eingeschätzt, da der Dollar direkt im Zentrum des Konflikts steht und Trump ihn schwächen will.\nGold: Wurde komplett verkauft (von ca. 2,8% auf 0,0%). Begründung:\n\nDie Stärke von Gold bei hohen Zinsen sei untypisch gewesen.\nDie Nachfrage sei von wenigen großen Käufern (Zentralbanken wie Russland, China) getrieben, deren Verhalten unsicher sei (z.B. Verkaufsdruck bei Russland durch Ölpreisverfall?).\nAls zuverlässige “Investitionsreserve”, die in der Krise funktionieren muss, wurde Gold als zu riskant/heiß eingestuft.\n\n\nAnleihen (Fixed Income): Die Duration (durchschnittliche Kapitalbindungsdauer) wurde erhöht, um die aktuell attraktiveren Langfristzinsen zu nutzen. Die Umlaufrendite im Fixed Income Portfolio sei wieder bei knapp 4%.\n\n\nRisiken und Ausblick:\n\nChina als Hauptrisiko: Während Beck erwartet, dass sich die Konflikte mit Europa, Japan etc. durch Deals lösen lassen (da die Handelsungleichgewichte z.T. gering sind - Fakt: US-EU Handelssaldo bei Waren+Dienstleistungen nur ca. 3% Defizit für USA, gegenseitige Zölle im Schnitt nur ca. 1%), sieht er das Verhältnis zu China als dauerhaft problematisch an. Hier gebe es einen parteiübergreifenden Konsens in den USA, China als Systemrivalen zu sehen. Eine Eskalation oder Beibehaltung von Maßnahmen gegen China sei wahrscheinlicher.\nTrump und der Markt: Die Idee, Trump wolle nur die Zinsen drücken, sei eine mögliche rationale Erklärung. Der Markt (insb. der Anleihemarkt) habe aber schon zurückgeschlagen (“List Trust Moment”), was Trump unter Druck setze (“Trump Put”).\nMögliche positive Wendung: Lochner wirft ein, ob die Krise nicht auch zur Chance werden könnte, Handelsbarrieren generell abzubauen. Beck hält ein Szenario für möglich, in dem Trump einen “Deal” verkündet und sich feiern lässt, was zu einem Schub führen könnte (außer potenziell bei China).\n“Luxuskrise”: Beck bezeichnet die Situation als “Luxuskrise”, weil die Ursache klar, die Lösung absehbar und die erwartete Dauer der akuten Phase kurz sei.\nKernbotschaft: Keine Panik. Auch wer zum Höchstkurs gekauft hat, solle Ruhe bewahren. Langfristig (Beispiel: 3 Jahre) seien solche Einbrüche oft nicht mehr relevant. Beck zeigt einen Langfristchart (Vanguard, MSCI World seit Start), der verdeutlicht, dass Bärenmärkte vorkommen, aber der langfristige Trend aufwärtsgerichtet ist. Fakt aus Chart: Bärenmärkte (-20%) dauern im Schnitt ca. 1 Jahr, 6 Monate.\n\nFazit: Andreas Beck sieht die aktuelle Marktkrise als politisch induziert und fundamental nicht so tiefgreifend wie frühere Krisen. Er hält die angedrohten Maßnahmen für unrealistisch und erwartet eine relativ baldige politische Lösung (Deal), außer potenziell im Verhältnis zu China. Er hat die Situation genutzt, um Aktien deutlich aufzustocken und dafür die als weniger sicher erachteten Teile der Reserve (USD-Anleihen, Gold) sowie die gut gelaufenen CHF-Anleihen zu verkaufen. Seine Hauptbotschaft an Anleger ist, Ruhe zu bewahren und nicht in Panik zu verkaufen."

    "text": ":Model Instructions:\n\n:You: please summarize this video in detail\n\n\n\nDevelopers Are WRONG About AI “Not Taking Our Jobs”\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, here is a detailed summary of the YouTube video “Developers Are WRONG About AI ‘Not Taking Our Jobs’” by Arseny Shatokhin:\nCore Argument:\nThe video argues strongly against the common sentiment among developers that AI will merely be a tool and won’t replace their jobs. The speaker, Arseny Shatokhin (who manages developers and builds AI agents), contends that AI is rapidly advancing towards automating and replacing a significant portion, if not the vast majority, of programming jobs, potentially as soon as 2025. He emphasizes that simply using AI tools (the “assistance” phase) is insufficient; developers need to prepare for a future of “agentic coding” where AI performs implementation autonomously.\nKey Points & Evidence:\n\nAlarming Predictions & Current Trends:\n\nOpens with quotes suggesting 50-90% of development will be done by AI very soon (within months to a year).\nHighlights recent tech layoffs (Google, Meta, Cisco etc.) happening concurrently with massive AI investments by the same companies.\nCites current AI models ranking high in programming benchmarks (top 50) and Sam Altman’s prediction of a #1 AI programmer by end of the year.\nMentions CEOs of Google and Microsoft stating AI already generates 20-30%+ of their internal code.\n\nHistorical Analogy: The Weavers:\n\nCompares the current situation to the Industrial Revolution’s impact on skilled weavers in the 19th century.\nWeaving was initially a high-paying, skilled, remote-friendly job (like developers).\nThe power loom (an automation tool) first increased productivity (1 weaver = 10-20x output) but led to factory work and wage drops.\nOver time (~100 years), the industry became almost fully automated, with machines replacing weavers entirely.\nArgues this transition from assistance to full automation could happen much faster now with AI (1-2 years vs. 150).\n\nThe Labor Automation Curve:\n\nPresents a model with three stages:\n\nManual: Linear effort-to-output.\nAssistance: Non-linear output; humans use tools to amplify effort (10x+). This is the current stage with AI co-pilots, IDEs (“vibe coding”). AI still needs supervision.\nAgency: Exponential output (1000x+); machines implement autonomously based on human design/direction (“agentic coding”). Humans focus on high-level strategy and oversight.\n\nPredicts we are rapidly moving from the end of the Assistance stage into the Agency stage.\n\nAddressing Counterarguments:\n\nAcknowledges skepticism: Cites an Antropic paper suggesting LLMs might mimic reasoning rather than truly think, and Yann LeCun’s view that LLMs might not be the path to AGI and past AI paradigms have hit limits.\nRebuttal: Argues that even if current LLMs aren’t the final answer, the current technology is already transformative enough to disrupt the industry significantly this year. The exact path to AGI doesn’t negate the immediate impact.\n\nDemo: AI Website Builder Agent:\n\nShowcases an AI agent built by his company that generates a complete Next.js e-commerce website.\nProcess involves: User provides logo/description -&gt; AI analyzes trends -&gt; AI sources products (Google Shopping API) -&gt; AI generates content & code -&gt; AI performs QA/validation -&gt; AI deploys to Vercel via GitHub -&gt; Final checks.\nEmphasizes this “agentic” approach is faster and more hands-free than “vibe coding” (AI assistance), handling complex tasks autonomously.\n\n\nThe 6-Step Survival Guide:\nThe core of the video provides actionable advice for developers:\n\nStay Ahead of the Curve: Actively research, test, and adopt the latest AI tools daily (coding IDEs, chat models, LLM APIs, UI builders, agent frameworks). Use resources like Twitter, newsletters (Readwise), and YouTube.\nMaster AI Coding (Assistance Stage): Learn to effectively use current AI tools for coding. Key tips: Plan/break down tasks, instruct AI to write tests first, use Memory/Context Providers (MCPs like MEM0), use different AI models strategically (e.g., GPT-4.1 for implementation, reasoning models for planning). This is a prerequisite for agentic coding.\nBuild AI Agents (Agency Stage): This is the most crucial skill. Learn how to build agents that automate tasks (essentially, learn to replace yourself). Follow an iterative process: Build MVP -&gt; Deploy -&gt; Evaluate (with real data) -&gt; Iterate.\nMove to Senior Roles: Focus on roles less easily automated: Architect, Product Lead, UX Designer. These require deep context, strategic thinking, understanding history, market, vision, and user experience – the “how” and “why,” not just the implementation “what.”\nStart a Side Hustle/Startup: Leverage AI’s productivity gains for yourself, not just an employer. Become an entrepreneur. AI enables solo founders or small teams to build significant businesses. Shift from accumulating salary to accumulating assets.\nShare Your Experience / Build a Brand: As implementation gets automated, distribution and authenticity become paramount. Build a personal brand, create content, foster a community. Genuine human connection is valuable and irreplaceable.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Learning Code:\n\nYes, still learn to code. Not primarily for a job writing code, but because:\n\nIt provides mental models to understand technology and communicate better with AI.\nIt’s necessary for building AI agents (most interact with code/APIs).\nIt develops crucial problem-solving skills needed to apply AI effectively.\n\n\nOverall Message:\nThe era of the traditional software developer whose primary skill is writing code is rapidly ending due to AI advancement. Developers must urgently adapt by mastering current AI tools, learning to build autonomous AI agents to automate tasks, moving into strategic/design roles, and potentially becoming entrepreneurs leveraging AI. Building a personal brand and community is also crucial for long-term relevance."

We’ve entered an “age of leverage” where a single individual (“one-person business” or “solopreneur”) can build a highly profitable (six or even seven-figure) business using AI as their primary workforce and leverage, guided by clarity and a strong point of view. The key is building systems, not conventional startups.\nIntroduction & Paradigm Shift:\n\nThe “industrial age” and “permission economy” are over. Value is now the brand, and AI is the workforce.\nThe only real gatekeeper is personal indecision.\nCorporations used to win with resources; now, “fifth lever disruptors” win with leverage and a point of view.\nAI agents are the highest leverage tools and are accessible to everyone.\nThe goal of the video is to outline the path to becoming a one-person AI-powered business.\n\nThree Essential Components:\nThe speaker identifies three core components needed:\n\nA Compelling Offer: Solving a specific, painful problem for a defined audience.\nAn AI-Powered System: Automating and scaling business operations without constant personal involvement.\nA Monetization Strategy: That doesn’t rely on chasing followers or seeking external funding.\n\nDebunking Old Business Myths (Why the Old Rules Don’t Apply):\nThe speaker systematically dismantles common beliefs that hold people back:\n\nMyth: You need a team.\n\nOld Thinking: Business means hierarchy, departments, meetings.\nNew Reality: Leverage &gt; Team. AI agents can perform tasks like writing, design, sales, scheduling, optimization without typical employee overhead. Marc Andreessen’s “Software is eating the world” now applies to AI. A solo operator with good tools/agents can outperform a poorly leveraged team.\n\nMyth: You need investors or a big budget.\n\nOld Thinking: Raise capital, build prototype, hope for acquisition.\nNew Reality: Focus &gt; Funding. Start with $0 investment. Offer value solving a painful problem. Execution is the leverage, not money. Use readily available tools (ChatGPT, Canva, Hostinger, N8N/Make/Zapier) to launch quickly. Value, offer, and execution are key.\n\nMyth: You need a new groundbreaking idea.\n\nOld Thinking: Must invent something completely new like Steve Jobs (who actually didn’t invent the smartphone but improved it).\nNew Reality: Make something work better. Serve an existing market more effectively than legacy players (referencing Peter Thiel’s “Zero to One” and Clayton Christensen’s “Innovator’s Dilemma”). AI provides the leverage to improve existing solutions (faster delivery, more personalization, better experience).\n\nMyth: You need a big audience.\n\nOld Thinking: Need millions of followers for success.\nNew Reality: Need ~1000 “true fans” (Kevin Kelly) or even just 100. Transformation &gt; Attention. Depth &gt; Reach. Monetization comes from providing real value to a smaller, engaged group.\n\nMyth: You need to be a coder or AI expert.\n\nOld Thinking: Technical skills are a prerequisite barrier.\nNew Reality: Need to apply AI, not necessarily build it. Identify real problems and let AI handle 80-90% of the work. It’s moved from “code to command” (referencing Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang). Human clarity and problem-solving ability are more important than deep AI literacy.\n\n\nThe New Way: Building with Structure\nThe new approach starts with structure, centered around the three core components:\nComponent 1: The Irresistible Offer\n\nProblem: Lack of clarity. Many want to make money but can’t define who they help, what problem they solve, and why they’re better (the “Offer Gap”).\nSolution: An offer is a promise that cuts through noise. It must be perceived as highly valuable (using Alex Hormozi’s formula: Desirability of Outcome + Likelihood of Success + Speed of Result + Ease of Process). It provides relief.\nKey Question: “What painful problem am I obsessed with solving so well that people would feel dumb not to hire me, buy from me, or follow me?”\nExamples: Automating course creator onboarding with AI, building AI agents for real estate follow-ups, creating AI-assisted children’s stories. These are clear, urgent, outcome-focused.\nFocus: Have a strong point of view and serve one specific person/pain point exceptionally well. This leads to organic growth without needing complex funnels initially.\n\nComponent 2: The AI-Powered System\n\nProblem: Most solo businesses become “burnout machines” where the owner is the business, essentially owning a demanding job.\nSolution: Build a system (a “machine”) that delivers the offer at scale without requiring constant personal intervention. Delegate tasks to AI tools.\nAnalogy: Business as a human body, with AI powering different functions:\n\nBrain (Strategy/Insight): AI agents research customer pain points, analyze competitors (Google AI Studio), act as a custom GPT business strategist.\nHeart/Mouth (Content/Communication): AI agents research topics, repurpose content, generate scripts, edit video, schedule posts, distribute across platforms. Goal: Become valuable and unmissable.\nLungs/Blood (Lead Gen/Sales): AI tools scrape leads (Apify), automate outreach (N8N), handle objections (Botpress), book calls (Vapi voice agents). Makes outreach relevant and scalable 24/7.\nHands (Fulfillment/Delivery): AI summarizes calls, drafts follow-ups, builds dashboards, generates onboarding docs, turns calls into reports. Frees the owner to be the expert, not the admin.\n\nGoal: Redeploy your time to high-value activities. Scale by removing yourself from the process, not your personality from the product.\n\nComponent 3: Monetization Without Followers or Funding\n\nProblem: Getting stuck on how to earn money without traditional metrics (audience size) or external capital.\nSolution: Choose a clear monetization path matched to the offer, powered by the AI system, and aligned with personal energy.\nThree Paths:\n\nDigital Products (Scalable Core): Specific products solving clear pains (e.g., Notion dashboard, niche prompt library, focused mini-course). Use AI to build/launch fast. Use platforms like Gumroad, Lemon Squeezy. Sell transformation (a “painkiller”).\nConsulting / Done-For-You / Done-With-You (Cash Flow Engine): Fastest path to revenue ($10k+). Solve real problems for businesses using AI (they want results, not to learn AI). Examples: custom AI agents for teams, AI-built funnels, automated content systems. Charge for results. Needs value, clarity, payment method. Cash flow first, infrastructure second.\nAI-Powered Content (Magnet): Create proof of thinking and expertise. Content = credibility. Use AI tools (Fathom, Opus Clip, writing agents) to document work and distribute insights efficiently. Builds trust, attracts leads. Valuable &gt; Viral.\n\n\nConclusion & Call to Action:\n\nRecap: Success requires a high-value offer, an AI system for leverage/freedom, and a suitable monetization flywheel.\nKey ingredients: Clarity, leverage, execution, and the willingness to build before fully believing.\nThe #1 Mistake (mentioned at start, reinforced): Having leverage (AI) without clarity/direction leads to chaos and wasted effort (“chasing the wrong things”). Clarity is paramount.\nInvitation to join the speaker’s free community (“The Trailblazers Hive”) for support.\nStandard YouTube outro encouraging engagement (like, subscribe, share).\n\nIn essence, the video provides a blueprint and mindset shift for leveraging AI to build a successful, lean, and freeing one-person business by focusing on solving specific problems with automated systems, rather than following outdated business paradigms."

He plans to focus on their discussion about AI’s impact on coding, open-source, agents, and particularly Zuckerberg’s “stunning claim” about AI self-improvement.\nAI’s Current Role in Coding:\n\nNadella (Microsoft): Discusses Microsoft’s use of AI in coding.\n\nTrack “accept rates” for AI code suggestions (around 30-40% and growing).\nChallenges exist, particularly with older languages like C++ where models aren’t as well-trained compared to Python (which benefits from vast open-source training data).\nAI is increasingly used for code reviews.\nEstimates maybe 20-30% of code in some specific Microsoft projects is now AI-written (combining completion and generation).\nNotes that “greenfield” (brand new) projects see higher AI contribution, but most work involves legacy codebases.\n\nZuckerberg (Meta): Doesn’t provide a specific percentage but agrees much current AI coding is “autocomplete variety.” Mentions focused experiments using AI for feed/ads ranking changes within contained domains.\nBerman’s Commentary:\n\nExplains the Python vs. C++ difference is due to available training data and the open-source nature of Python tools/libraries.\nHighlights that while Microsoft faces challenges with its massive legacy codebase (“nothing is greenfield”), this doesn’t stop startups from building new things optimized for AI iteration, potentially outpacing Microsoft.\nAgrees code review is a good AI use case due to its focused nature (reviewing code diffs).\nClarifies Nadella’s percentage likely mixes simple code completion with more advanced agent-driven coding.\n\n\nZuckerberg’s “Stunning Claim”: AI Self-Improvement:\n\nZuckerberg: States Meta’s major focus is building an AI/ML engineer specifically to advance the development of Llama itself.\n\nHis “bet” is that within the next year, maybe half of Llama’s development will be done by AI, and this percentage will increase.\n\nBerman’s Commentary:\n\nCalls this the most important point of the talk, directly referencing the concept of an intelligence explosion.\nOnce AI can iterate and improve itself, progress becomes exponential, limited only by the compute/agents applied.\nSuggests Zuckerberg might be thinking further ahead on self-improving AI than Nadella, possibly because Meta develops its own foundational models, whereas Microsoft primarily partners. He also notes potential strategic posturing between the CEOs.\n\n\nThe Future of Software Development, Tools & Skills:\n\nNadella: Sees the “SWE agent” (Software Engineering agent) as the current direction. Predicts AI agents will likely handle tasks like kernel optimization and security improvements before tackling novel model architecture changes. Emphasizes the need to rethink the entire tech stack (tools, infrastructure, sandboxes, GitHub repo structure) for agents.\nZuckerberg: Envisions future engineers acting more like “tech leads,” orchestrating their “own little army” of AI engineering agents.\nBerman’s Commentary:\n\nExpands on the “orchestrator” role.\nPonders what multi-agent collaboration on codebases will look like (hundreds of agents on one branch?).\nAddresses the common question: “Should I still learn to code?” His answer: Yes, for now. But long-term, the core skill will be systems thinking (which coding teaches) and learning to interact with/orchestrate AI agents. Actual line-by-line coding might become more “artisanal.”\n\n\nBlurring Lines Between Applications, Documents, and Data Interaction:\n\nNadella: Discusses the blurring lines between chat sessions, documents, and applications. Envisions starting with high-level intent in a chat, which evolves into a “living artifact” (an application). Compares this potential unification to past failed attempts to merge Office apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), suggesting AI now makes this feasible due to increased “malleability.”\nBerman’s Commentary:\n\nInterprets this as a shift in the human-data interface.\nProposes a future architecture: Ground Truth Data (deterministic database) -&gt; Agentic Layer (AI does the work) -&gt; Human Orchestrator.\nRaises the provocative idea that traditional “software applications” might cease to exist in this model (“Software is dead”).\n\n\nAI’s Economic Impact and Productivity:\n\nNadella: Links AI investment to needing GDP growth. Views AI as a potential new “factor of production” essential for solving global challenges and enabling high growth rates (e.g., 10% in developed world). This requires real productivity gains across all industries, which necessitates not just new software but also management change and workflow redesign. Draws parallels to the adoption of electricity, which took decades and required rethinking factory layouts (Ford example), hoping AI adoption will be faster.\nBerman’s Commentary: Reinforces Nadella’s point about AI’s promise in tackling significant problems.\n\nAI as a Major Platform Shift & Reimagining Infrastructure:\n\nNadella: Compares the current AI transition to previous major shifts (client-server, web). Each shift requires “relitigating” the entire tech stack and rebuilding from first principles. Examples: cloud storage for AI training differs significantly from earlier systems like Hadoop.\nBerman’s Commentary: Calls this the most exciting aspect – the chance to reimagine everything. Warns against simply forcing AI into old patterns (like early web merely replicating print media). Praises newer AI-native coding tools (Cursor, Replit, etc.) that are starting to rethink the developer experience from the ground up for an AI-first world.\n\nEfficiency Gains, Consumption, and Jevons Paradox:\n\nNadella: Describes the current era as a “hyperdrive Moore’s Law,” with compounding efficiency gains across chips (Nvidia/AMD), systems, model architectures, optimizations (inference, caching). Estimates ~10x improvements every 6-12 months. These rapid capability increases and price drops lead to fundamentally higher consumption (Jevons Paradox). He’s optimistic this enables building “deep applications.”\nBerman’s Commentary: Explains Jevons Paradox (efficiency increasing, not decreasing, total consumption) using the DeepSeek Coder release as an example. Agrees with Nadella that the “application layer” built on top of models/infra is a huge opportunity now, alongside building the necessary AI infrastructure/scaffolding (memory management, agent frameworks, tool use, etc.).\n\nMulti-Model Ecosystem and Open Source:\n\nNadella: Foresees applications becoming multi-modal, orchestrating different models and agents (mentions protocols like MCP, A2N). Believes open source has a massive role to play, driven by customer demand for flexibility and the need for enterprises to sometimes distill models using their own IP (where open weights have an advantage). Recounts learning the importance of interoperability early in his career (Windows NT vs. Unix). States Microsoft isn’t dogmatic; both open and closed models are needed.\nBerman’s Commentary: Credits Nadella’s embrace of open source alongside the OpenAI partnership as a strategic “4D chess” move to mitigate platform risk (dependency on OpenAI). Expresses surprise at the emphasis on enterprise model distillation, arguing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is often sufficient.\n\nEvolution of Agents and Integration:\n\nNadella: Traces the evolution of GitHub Copilot: simple completion -&gt; chat (staying in flow) -&gt; agentic workflow (assigning tasks) -&gt; proto-agent (higher-level assignments). Stresses the importance of integrating these capabilities into existing developer workflows and repos for adoption, as most work isn’t greenfield.\nBerman’s Commentary: Contrasts Nadella’s focus on integration with his own excitement for the “greenfield” potential – completely rethinking IDEs and even the nature of code itself when primarily written for and by agents (possibly non-human-readable).\n\nExplosion of Code Generation & Democratization:\n\nBerman: Cites impressive statistics from Cursor’s CEO (Aman Sanger) about generating nearly 1 billion lines of accepted code per day. Puts this in perspective against the few billion lines produced globally daily. Predicts an explosion not just in the amount of code written, but also in the number of people who can code, thanks to natural language interfaces and tools (“vibe coding”), leading to democratization.\n\nConclusion:\nBerman briefly mentions final topics like model distillation and a call for developers to build meaningful tools, then wraps up the video."

    "section": "",
    "text": ":Model Instructions:\n\n:You: From a youTube transcript I want to retrieve the best condensed explanations.\n\n\n\nFather of AI: AI Needs PHYSICS to EVOLVE | prof. Yann LeCun\n\n\n\n:01JNZZ2YCRJES6A7SHKZH7E4RK::claude-3-5-sonnet-latest: From this interview with Yann LeCun, here are the key explanations on several important topics:\n\nOn Current AI Limitations: “Currently AI systems are in many ways very stupid. We are fooled into thinking they are smart because they can manipulate language very well. They can’t understand the physical world, they don’t have any persistent memory, they can’t really reason and they can’t plan.”\nOn Why Language Models Work But Physical World Understanding Doesn’t: “Language is simple because it’s discrete - it’s a sequence of discrete symbols. There’s only a finite number of possible words in a dictionary. But you cannot train a system to predict what’s going to happen in a video… the physical world is much more difficult to understand than language.”\nOn Three Paradigms of Machine Learning:\n\n\nSupervised Learning: Show system examples with correct answers\nReinforcement Learning: Only tell system if answer was good/bad\nSelf-Supervised Learning: Train system to capture input structure (like predicting missing words)\n\n\nOn Information Processing Differences Between AI and Humans: “A typical large language model is trained with about 20 trillion tokens… compare this with the amount of information that gets to our brain through the visual system in the first four years of life and it’s about the same amount. What it tells you is that we’re never going to get to human level AI by just training on text.”\nOn Future AI Architecture (JEPA): “Instead of making prediction in the space of inputs, you train the system to learn an abstract representation of the input and then train it to make predictions in that representation space… because you cannot predict all the details of what’s going to be in the field of view, it’s just impossible to predict and so if you’re training a system to make those predictions it spends a huge amount of resources trying to predict things it cannot predict.”\n\nThese explanations highlight LeCun’s view that current AI systems, while impressive with language, still lack fundamental capabilities for understanding and operating in the physical world, and that new approaches are needed to advance AI further.\n\n:You: What is happening in the near future and what is his takes on AI assistants?\n\n:01JNZZ2YCRJES6A7SHKZH7E4RK::claude-3-5-sonnet-latest: According to LeCun’s interview, here are his key points about the near future and AI assistants:\nOn Near Future AI Assistants: “All the companies that are involved in AI are seeing a future pretty near future where billions of people will want to use AI assistants on a daily basis.” He envisions this happening through:\n\nWearable Technology:\n\n\nSmart glasses (like the Meta glasses he demonstrates)\nSmartphones\nSmart devices\nPeople will “use AI assistants all the time in their daily lives”\n\n\nInfrastructure Requirements:\n\n\nWill need massive computing infrastructure due to billions of users using AI multiple times daily\nMajor investments are being made:\n\nMeta: $60-65 billion in infrastructure (mostly for AI)\nMicrosoft: $80 billion announced\nMost of this investment is for “inference” (running AI assistants) rather than training models\n\n\n\nImportant Distinction on Costs:\n\n\nTraining models may become cheaper\nBut the main cost and investment will be in running these models for daily use\n“Most of the infrastructure and most of the investment goes into actually running the models, not training them”\n\n\nReality Check on Recent Developments:\n\n\nHe dismisses the market’s excitement about cheaper training (like with Deeps)\nWhile training might become more efficient, we’ll just train bigger models\nThe real cost challenge remains in deployment and running these systems at scale\n\nLeCun’s take suggests we’re heading toward ubiquitous AI assistants in daily life, but the challenge isn’t in creating them - it’s in deploying them at scale for billions of users."

    "text": ":Model Instructions:\n\n:You: please summarize this video in detail\n\n\n\nGive Me 28 Minutes and I’ll Completely Change the Way You Build AI Agents\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, here is a detailed summary of the YouTube video “Give Me 28 Minutes and I’ll Completely Change the Way You Build AI Agents” by Cole Medin:\nCore Problem & Proposed Solution:\nThe video addresses the challenge of building complex, robust AI agents, which goes beyond simply connecting an LLM to a few tools. The speaker, Cole Medin, notes that while basic agents are easy with no-code tools or assistants, tackling complex problems requires a structured approach. He introduces his mental model, the “Seven Node Blueprint for AI Agents,” designed to break down any complex agent-building task into manageable components.\nFundamental Principle: Agents as Graphs\nBefore detailing the nodes, Medin emphasizes a core concept: AI agents are fundamentally graphs.\n\nUnlike traditional linear workflows, agents involve cycles: LLM reasoning -&gt; Tool usage -&gt; Feedback -&gt; LLM reasoning, etc.\nThis cyclical, graph-like structure enables non-deterministic behavior, where the agent’s path isn’t fixed.\nThinking of agents as graphs allows developers to break them down into distinct components (nodes or “Lego bricks”) that can be built individually and combined.\n\nThe Seven Node Blueprint:\nThe framework categorizes all components of an AI agent into one of seven types of “nodes”:\n\nLLM Node: The “brain” of the agent. This is the Large Language Model itself (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3.7) responsible for reasoning, decision-making, and deciding when to use tools.\nTool Node: Performs actions on behalf of the LLM. Examples include web searches, code execution, database queries, API calls, etc. The LLM invokes these nodes.\nControl Node: Adds deterministic logic and structure to the agent’s workflow. Unlike LLM nodes, these use predefined rules, code, or standard workflow logic (e.g., filters, conditional routing, if/else statements). They ensure specific actions happen predictably based on certain conditions or outputs.\nMemory Node: Handles the agent’s memory. This includes:\n\nShort-term memory: Conversation history within a single session.\nLong-term memory: Persistent knowledge, often stored in vector databases or other knowledge bases, retrieved and updated across sessions. (Example shown uses a Google Doc for simplicity, mentions Mem O library).\n\nGuardrail Node: Ensures reliability and safety. These nodes validate inputs or outputs:\n\nInput Guardrails: Check user input before it reaches the main agent (e.g., is the budget request reasonable?).\nOutput Guardrails: Check the agent’s output before presenting it (e.g., does the generated itinerary match the requested duration? Does the output format meet requirements?). Can use LLMs or deterministic checks.\n\nFallback Node: Handles errors gracefully. Instead of crashing, these nodes define what happens when something goes wrong (e.g., retry the failed step, provide a default error message to the user, log the error, alert an administrator).\nUser Input Node: Allows for human interaction mid-process (“human-in-the-loop”). This node pauses the agent’s execution to wait for user feedback, confirmation, or additional input before proceeding (e.g., confirming a hotel booking before executing it).\n\nExamples Using N8N:\nMedin uses the visual workflow tool N8N to demonstrate each concept:\n\nBasic Agent (LLM, Tool, Short-term Memory): Shows a simple agent creating dishes and adding them to Airtable, illustrating the LLM-Tool cycle.\nLong-term Memory: Adds steps to retrieve relevant info (user dislikes spicy mango) from a Google Doc before the LLM generates a dish, and a step to extract and save new memories after.\nUser Input & Control Nodes: An agent proposes sending a Slack message. A User Input node sends an approval request to the user via Slack DM. A Control Node then routes the flow based on the user’s response (approve/decline), sending the message or a different notification accordingly.\nGuardrail Node (Output): An agent generates a dish. An output guardrail (a “critic” LLM) checks if the output includes required elements (name, description, origin). If not, it provides feedback and triggers a retry (using another agent node).\nFallback Node: Modifies the User Input/Control example. If the user declines the Slack message, the Control Node routes to an error step, which triggers a dedicated error workflow (Fallback Node) that sends an alert (e.g., Slack message to an admin).\n\n(Sponsor Break): Mentions Bright Data and their MCP server as a way to give agents unblockable, real-time web access for tasks like scraping LinkedIn bios or finding flight information, demonstrating its integration with an agent framework (Pydantic AI).\nComprehensive Example Combining All Nodes:\nMedin presents a more complex N8N workflow demonstrating how all seven nodes work together to create a robust dish-generating agent:\n\nMemory Node: Fetches long-term memory (user preferences).\nLLM Node + Tool Node + Memory Node (Short-term): Primary agent generates a dish, using a tool to check an Airtable menu (avoid duplicates) and considering conversation history.\nGuardrail Node: An “output parser” ensures the output format (dish name, description) is correct, using a secondary LLM for auto-fixing if needed.\nUser Input Node: Sends the proposed dish to Slack for human approval.\nControl Node: Routes based on approval.\n\nIf Approved: Sends confirmation (Control Node), adds dish to Airtable (Control Node).\nIf Declined: Triggers error workflow (Fallback Node).\n\nMemory Node: Another LLM extracts key memories from the interaction (e.g., user requested no existing menu items).\nMemory Node: Saves extracted memories to long-term storage (Google Doc).\nLLM Node: Summarizes and presents the final output.\n\nConclusion & Takeaway:\nThe Seven Node Blueprint provides a structured way to think about and build complex AI agents by breaking the problem into manageable parts. By considering each node type (Do I need memory? What guardrails? How should errors be handled?), developers can systematically design more robust and reliable agents. The graph-based nature of agents is key to this modular approach. Medin plans future content on specific nodes and frameworks like Pydantic AI and LangGraph that embrace this graph abstraction."

    "section": "",
    "text": ":Model Instructions:\n\n:You: please summarize this video in detail\n\n\n\nVoice to Claude Code: SPEAK to SHIP Agentic Coding AI Assistant\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, here is a detailed summary of the YouTube video “Voice to Claude Code: SPEAK to SHIP Agentic Coding AI Assistant” by IndyDevDan:\nCore Concept:\nThe video demonstrates a custom-built personal AI assistant that uses real-time speech-to-text to capture voice commands, processes them using Anthropic’s Claude Code (a powerful AI coding tool), and responds with voice output (using OpenAI’s TTS). The core idea is to enable developers to interact with and modify their codebase through natural language speech, effectively “speaking to ship” code.\nKey Demonstrations & Workflow:\n\nInitial Setup & Simple Tasks:\n\nThe demo starts with the assistant listening (“Claude, are you ready to build?”).\nDemo 1: A voice command asks Claude Code to generate “Hello World” examples for the 6 most popular programming languages (Python, JS, Java, C++, Go, Ruby) inside a starter_coding directory. This is executed successfully.\nDemo 2: A follow-up command asks Claude Code to modify these examples to make HTTP requests using a URL passed as a command-line parameter and to comment every line. This is also shown working.\n\nAssistant Architecture Reveal:\n\nThe speaker (Dan) explains the system: real-time speech-to-text -&gt; agentic coding tool (Claude Code).\nHe highlights that the entire assistant is built within a single Python file (~700 lines) comprising:\n\nEars: Real-time speech-to-text library (real-time-speech-to-text).\nBrain: Claude Code, invoked as a programmable tool via a subprocess call.\nVoice: OpenAI’s Text-to-Speech (TTS) API. Includes a step using GPT-4o Mini to summarize Claude Code’s potentially verbose output before synthesizing speech.\n\nTrigger Words: The assistant doesn’t act on all speech. It waits for trigger words (like “Sonnet”, “Claude”) before processing the preceding speech as a command for Claude Code.\n\nRefactoring the Assistant’s Own Code:\n\nDan identifies a flaw in his assistant’s script: a hardcoded list of allowed Claude Code tools.\nDemo 3: He uses a voice command (“Sonnet, go ahead and update…”) to instruct the assistant to refactor its own code, replacing the hardcoded list with a constant defined earlier in the file (default_cloud_code_tools).\nThe assistant successfully uses Claude Code to make this change, demonstrating its ability to modify its own source code based on voice commands.\nHe acknowledges the time delay involved in the process (speech processing + Claude Code execution).\n\nPlanning and Implementing a New Feature (Anthropic Web Search):\n\nDan wants to create a script utilizing Anthropic’s new web search tool.\nDemo 4 (Planning): He instructs the assistant (“Sonnet, read a couple files…”) to read relevant documentation (a UV script template and the web search tool docs stored locally in AI_Docs) and generate a plan (specification) for a new Python script. This spec is written to a specs directory. He then refines the plan via voice command to include concrete code examples from the documentation. This highlights the principle “great planning is great prompting.”\nContext Reusability: He discusses Claude Code’s continue and resume features but explains his system uses a simple file-based conversation tracker (output/CC) because invoking Claude Code programmatically requires manual context management.\nDemo 5 (Implementation): He commands the assistant (“Claude, go ahead and read the… spec and let’s go ahead and implement this…”) to use the generated spec to write the actual Python script (anthropic_search.py) and a README file.\nDemo 6 (Testing): He quickly runs the generated script to perform a web search (“anthropic claude code”), which mostly works.\nDemo 7 (Cleanup): He uses the assistant via voice command (“Sonnet, can you go ahead and take…”) to merge the newly generated README into the main project README and delete the duplicate file, demonstrating file manipulation capabilities. He emphasizes committing code frequently when performing potentially destructive actions.\n\n\nKey Arguments & Philosophy:\n\nCompute Equals Success: The central value proposition is that tools like this allow engineers to scale their compute, leading to greater success and productivity in the generative AI age.\nClaude Code as a Programmable Agentic Tool: Dan strongly argues that Claude Code is unique and powerful because it’s not just an AI coding assistant but a programmable agentic tool. This means it can be embedded in scripts, workflows, use custom tools via prompts, and be orchestrated, unlike tools like Cursor or Aider (which he views as more limited AI coding tools).\nCost vs. Value (ROI): He is transparent about the high cost of using Claude Code ($100 in 10 days shown), framing it as an investment. The focus should be on the Return on Investment (ROI) – if the tool provides more value than its cost, it’s worth it. He introduces the “compute advantage equation” - comparing the ROI across different tools.\nClaude Code Max Plan: He discusses the new $100/month Max plan but is unsure if it offers cost savings for heavy API users like himself compared to pay-as-you-go, though it seems beneficial for those heavily using the Claude web/desktop interface alongside Claude Code.\nIndustry Recognition: He notes the growing discussion around Claude Code (e.g., on Hacker News) as validation of its importance.\nChannel Mission: He takes a moment to thank his viewers (approaching 50k subs) and outlines his priorities: 1) Build living software, 2) Unlock engineering potential, 3) Make a living (in that order), emphasizing his goal to provide unique, practical value.\n\nResources & Conclusion:\n\nThe codebase for the voice assistant (claude-code-is-programmable) is available on GitHub (link implied to be in description).\nHe promotes his course “Principled AI Coding” and hints at a future, more advanced course on agentic coding.\nHe concludes that while voice interaction has pros and cons (speed, cost), it’s a powerful way to scale engineering compute and impact using agentic tools like Claude Code.\n\nIn essence, the video showcases a practical, albeit costly and sometimes slow, implementation of a voice-controlled AI coding assistant built around the programmable capabilities of Claude Code, arguing that such agentic approaches are key to leveraging AI for significantly enhanced developer productivity."

    "text": ":Model Instructions:\n\n:You: please summarize this video in detail\n\n\n\n5 Industries Desperately Paying for AI Automation (2025)\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, here is a detailed summary of the YouTube video “5 Industries Desperately Paying for AI Automation (2025)” by Nick Saraev:\nOverall Theme: The video identifies five specific industries that are highly receptive and willing to pay significant amounts for AI automation services today (and projecting into 2025). Nick Saraev positions these as lucrative niches for AI automation agencies, explaining the specific pain points and characteristics of each industry that make them ideal candidates, and suggesting concrete automation solutions that can be sold to them. He emphasizes the business value and ROI potential of these automations.\nIndustry 1: Coaching and Consulting\n\nWhy they need automation:\n\nHigh Engagement Cost/Client Value: Clients often pay $10k+, making it easy to demonstrate a strong ROI (e.g., getting one client via automation can yield a 2x-6x+ return on a $5k automation service).\nPersonalized Communication Dependency: Often built around a single personality (like Sam Ovens mentioned). Automation can increase the efficiency of this person’s time, scaling revenue potential without linearly scaling time commitment. Even a small % efficiency gain has a large impact over time.\nHigh Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): Improving margins through automation is highly valuable. Small percentage point increases in margin (e.g., 10% to 11%) represent significant overall business improvement (10% in this example).\nRecurring Revenue Models: Many have communities or retainers, amplifying the long-term value of automation.\nAdmin Tasks: Standard administrative burdens common to many businesses.\nData Tracking: Often track progress and metrics, making it easier to prove automation value.\nReputation-Based: Improving customer experience through automation directly impacts their reputation and success.\n\nExample Automations to Sell:\n\nClient onboarding flows\nContent delivery systems (repurposing/multiplication)\nPayment collection & automated invoice follow-up\nCommunity management automations/systems (SOPs included)\nLead nurturing & follow-ups\nRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) FAQ chatbots / AI versions of the coach based on their content.\n\n\nIndustry 2: Recruitment, Staffing, and Offshore Talent Agencies\n\nWhy they need automation:\n\nHigh Volume of Candidates/Tasks: Deal with hundreds/thousands of candidates weekly, involving many repetitive communication tasks and stages. Prime for automation.\nManual Communication: Lots of similar, manual comms across many candidates.\nLogging & Metrics: Need consistent logging for KPIs (candidate reply rates, conversion rates). Automation provides this easily.\nDigital-First/Tech-Savvy: Generally understand digital tools (like cold email platforms), making them receptive.\nHigh Placement Fees: Earn significant fees ($5k-$20k+, sometimes % of salary, e.g., $40k on a $200k placement). High ROI potential for growth-focused automation (getting just one extra placement justifies high fees).\nData-Rich Databases: Have lots of data that can be leveraged.\nSome Recurring Models: Amplifies value.\n\nExample Automations to Sell:\n\nCandidate pipelines management\nCandidate sourcing systems (automated cold email)\nEmployer sourcing systems (outreach)\nAutomating client/candidate communications\nAutomated reference/record checks\nPersonalized cold outreach (to employers)\nCandidate reactivation systems\nPlacement tracking dashboards\n\n\nIndustry 3: Digital Marketing and Creative Agencies\n\nWhy they need automation:\n\nHigh Engagement Costs: Projects/retainers can range from $3k-$50k+.\nHighly Digital: Easy to find and reach these agencies (scraping tools like Apollo/Amplify). They are used to digital communication.\nOften Poor Margins: Typical margins (30-40%) are lower than other businesses (like Nick’s own 80-90%). Small margin improvements via automation have a relatively larger impact.\nLow Billable Time / Heavy Admin: Need efficiency gains.\nLow Barrier to Entry: Many newer agencies lack basic systems for client comms, time tracking, invoicing, etc. Simple automations provide substantial value (“low bar”).\n\nExample Automations to Sell:\n\nProject Management (PM) automation (setting up Monday.com, ClickUp, Asana, Slack workflows)\nClient intake systems\nResource allocation dashboards / Time tracking systems\nInvoice and payment automation (often a major pain point – agencies forget to invoice!)\nProposal generation automation\nClient feedback collection\nDigital asset organization\nHuman-in-the-loop Q&A systems\nAI for creative asset production\n\n\nIndustry 4: B2B Tech and High-Touch SaaS Companies (Distinguishes between Low-Touch SaaS - cheap, self-serve, vs. High-Touch SaaS - expensive, requires demos/sales teams)\n\nWhy they need automation (High-Touch SaaS):\n\nHigh Customer Lifetime Value (LTV): Can be $6k - $24k+ annually.\nComplex Sales Cycles: Often involve demos, proposals, multiple touches, similar to agencies. Automation systems are transferable.\nStack of Disconnected Tools: Especially if VC-funded and grew quickly. Auditing and optimizing the tech stack can save thousands monthly ($2-$3k/month = $24k+/year), creating immediate value and buying time for the automation agency.\nData-Driven: Already track KPIs, receptive to data-backed improvements.\nAutomation-Friendly: Often have internal dev resources, understand tech concepts.\nNuanced Pain Points: Serve niche markets; even small system improvements addressing specific pain points are highly valued.\nGood Margins/Funding: Often have &gt;70% margins and/or recent funding, leading to more disposable income and potentially less scrutiny on spending.\n\nExample Automations to Sell:\n\nLead qualification systems (routing leads based on inputs)\nDemo booking automation\nPersonalized sales outreach (outbound works well for high-touch)\nSupport ticket automation (routing, basic refunds, using tools like n8n agents - Nick notes this is one of the few current good uses for agents)\nAutomated feedback collection (e.g., on cancellation)\n\n\nIndustry 5: Financial Services / Companies\n\nCaveat: Can face strict regulations (similar to HIPAA in healthcare), potentially requiring complex, on-premise solutions. However, not all financial service companies are like this.\nWhy they need automation:\n\nVery High Client LTV: Potentially up to $500k.\nReporting and Compliance Burden: A major operational cost. Automating even parts of compliance (with human review) offers massive value.\nHigh-Touch Client Communication/Relationships: Automation that enhances perceived personalization (making automated messages feel personal) is extremely valuable, especially with potentially older-school, relationship-focused clients.\nHeavy Admin Load: Need to free up time for advising.\nFamiliarity with Tools: Often use spreadsheets/databases informally; simple Make.com/n8n flows can integrate easily and provide outsized value.\nRecurring Revenue: Many operate on MRR.\nHigh CAC: Margin improvements are valuable.\n\nExample Automations to Sell:\n\nClient onboarding (emphasizing high-touch, personalized feel)\nContent personalization (feeding into relationship building)\nCompliance monitoring & automation systems\nAutomated Q&A / simple support\nDocument/file organization (e.g., auto-creating structured Google Drive folders linked to CRM records).\n\n\nConclusion & Call to Action: Nick emphasizes that the document with all this information is available in the description. He promotes his communities: * Maker School: For beginners aiming to get their first AI automation client in 90 days (with a money-back guarantee). * Make Money with Make: For existing automation businesses looking to scale to $25k/month+. He finishes with a standard YouTube call to like, subscribe, etc."

    "text": ":Model Instructions:\n\n:You: please summarize this video in detail\n\n\n\nTop 10 MCP Use Cases - Using Claude & Model Context Protocol\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, here is a detailed summary of the YouTube video “Top 10 MCP Use Cases - Using Claude & Model Context Protocol”:\nIntroduction:\nThe video introduces the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a way for AI agents (like Claude) to interact with and control various tools. These tools can be on the user’s local computer (like the file system or terminal) or third-party services (like Figma, Docker, Gmail). The video aims to showcase 10 practical use cases for MCP for developers and designers.\nSetup Process:\n\nInterface: The presenter uses Claude Desktop as the primary interface to connect AI models with the desired tools via MCP.\nCompatibility: MCP works on both macOS (preferred) and Windows, though setup might differ slightly.\nInstallation & Login: Claude Desktop needs to be installed and logged into (e.g., using Google OAuth).\nEnabling Developer Mode: The crucial step is enabling developer mode within Claude Desktop settings.\nConfiguration: Users need to edit the JSON configuration file (opened via the developer settings) to grant MCP access to specific protocols/tools. The presenter demonstrates adding configuration for file system access, requiring the user to update the placeholder username with their actual username.\nRestart & Verification: After saving the configuration and restarting Claude Desktop, a new “tool icon” appears, indicating MCP is active. Clicking it shows the installed MCP protocols/tools available.\n\nTop MCP Use Cases Demonstrated:\n\nFile Organization:\n\nGoal: Automatically organize a messy folder, like the Downloads folder.\nProcess: Grant Claude access to the specified directory (requires user approval). Claude lists files and folders, then follows prompts to organize them (e.g., move files into type-specific folders like Images, Installers, Videos) and delete duplicates.\nResult: A much neater folder structure. (Mentioned hitting message length limits during the process).\n\nSending Emails:\n\nGoal: Have the AI compose and send emails directly from the user’s email account, bypassing manual copy-pasting.\nTool: Uses Zapier Actions as an MCP server to connect Claude to Gmail.\nSetup: Connect Gmail action in Zapier. Copy the provided MCP server configuration (including a secret key) from Zapier into the Claude Desktop JSON configuration file. Restart Claude.\nExample: Prompt Claude to send an email to the user about a design course (“enhanced UI”). Claude uses the Zapier MCP tool (requiring approval) to send the email.\nResult: The email arrives immediately, sent from the user’s actual email address with the requested content and links.\n\nEmail Management:\n\nGoal: Use AI to manage and organize the email inbox.\nTool: Adds more Zapier actions for Gmail (labeling, deleting, finding emails).\nExample: Prompt Claude to organize the inbox. Claude scans emails, labels important ones, and deletes unwanted ones (like the previous test email).\nOther Possibilities: Mentioned using MCP for drafting replies or other email tasks.\n\nWeb Browser Control (Web Scraping/Summarization):\n\nGoal: Allow the AI to control a web browser to perform tasks online.\nTool: Uses Puppeteer (a Node library to control Chrome/Chromium) integrated as an MCP tool via a specific “web tool” configuration syntax added to the JSON file.\nExample: Ask Claude to summarize the best articles from dev.to from the past week. Claude requests permission, launches Puppeteer (visible browser window), navigates the site, gathers information, and provides a summary of relevant articles.\n\nWhatsApp Messaging:\n\nGoal: Send messages directly to WhatsApp via the AI.\nTool: Connects WhatsApp via Zapier Actions, making it available as an MCP tool in Claude.\nExample: Ask Claude to send a “Hello World” message along with an explanation of a JavaScript function to the user’s WhatsApp number.\nResult: The message appears on the user’s WhatsApp.\n\n\nOther Mentioned Use Cases (Briefly Shown/Discussed):\n\nBlender Integration: Connecting Claude to Blender via MCP to generate and manipulate 3D models and scenes based on prompts or even reference images (e.g., from Midjourney). Includes an example of recreating a Blender model as a web-based 3D scene using JavaScript/Three.js.\nFigma Integration: Controlling Figma via MCP to create UI designs (e.g., designing a mobile login screen).\nDocker Control: Managing Docker containers and images.\nGitHub Updates: Interacting with GitHub repositories (e.g., updating code).\nSpotify Control: Managing Spotify libraries or playback.\n\nConclusion:\nThe presenter emphasizes that these examples are just the “tip of the iceberg.” MCP allows connecting AI to potentially anything imaginable using official or third-party MCP servers. The video ends by asking viewers if they found it interesting and if they’d like a deeper dive into MCP and its creative possibilities."

    "text": ":Model Instructions:\n\n:You: please summarize this video in detail\n\n\n\nClaude with MCPs Replaced Cursor & Windsurf — How Did That Happen?\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, here is a detailed summary of the YouTube video “Claude with MCPs Replaced Cursor & Windsurf — How Did That Happen?” by Eduards Ruzga:\nCore Argument & Introduction:\n\nThe speaker, Eduards Ruzga, explains that he has unexpectedly stopped using paid tools like Windsurf (code-aware IDE/chat) and Cursor (AI-first code editor), despite having started paying for Windsurf in December.\nThe primary reason for this shift is his adoption and development of a system combining Anthropic’s Claude AI with MCPs (Master Control Programs/Protocols).\nHe highlights that giving Claude access to tools via MCPs drastically increases its utility. His own usage of Claude has increased 5x in the last three months compared to previous periods, demonstrating this enhanced value.\nHe has developed his own “mCP server” which allows Claude to interact with the user’s local machine. This server enables:\n\nRunning long-running processes (e.g., video encoding) without blocking the chat, managing them via process IDs.\nAccessing the file system for tasks like large codebase exploration, reading files/READMEs, generating documentation, and creating diagrams.\nEditing code files, including diff editing, multi-file editing, and even multi-repository operations (he gives an example of migrating 30 files/3.5k lines for a side project with only one manual fix needed).\n\n\nMCP Server Installation:\n\nEduards has published his mCP server to npm and made it easily installable via Smi (Sidecar Manager Interface).\nHe demonstrates the simple, one-line installation process in the terminal, requiring only Node.js and the Claude Desktop App to be pre-installed.\nAfter restarting the Claude app, the server automatically connects and adds around 19 tools (list directories, edit files, execute commands, kill processes, etc.) to Claude’s capabilities within the chat interface.\n\nDemonstration 1: Codebase Exploration & Diagramming:\n\nHe showcases using Claude + MCPs to explore the mCP server’s own codebase.\nHe instructs Claude to explore a given directory path, read relevant files (README, package.json, source files), understand the structure and functionality, and generate Mermaid.js diagrams directly within the chat window.\nClaude successfully lists files, reads key code files, and produces several diagrams (component, sequence, architecture) explaining how the mCP server works, including handling terminal commands and long-running processes.\nHe praises this as a way to quickly understand unfamiliar codebases and highlights the advantage of having visual artifacts directly in the chat, something not typically done with Windsurf/Cursor.\n\nComparison with Windsurf:\n\nHe attempts the same codebase exploration and diagramming task using Windsurf (with Claude 3 Sonnet model).\nWindsurf can perform the task but requires generating an external HTML file for the diagrams, lacking the inline visual benefit.\nHe points out several friction points with Windsurf for this use case: needing to open the project folder first, waiting for indexing/loading, occasional errors (like a “Cascade” error during his first attempt), sometimes reading only partial files (though it seemed okay in this specific instance), and generally feeling less direct and more cumbersome than simply giving Claude a path.\n\nDemonstration 2: Long-Running Processes (Video Encoding):\n\nHe shows a pre-recorded chat demonstrating Claude using the mCP server to compress a large video file (2.5GB) using FFmpeg.\nClaude executes commands to analyze the file, then starts the FFmpeg compression process.\nCrucially, the mCP server runs FFmpeg in the background, returns a process ID to Claude, and allows Claude to periodically query the process for new output/status updates without blocking the chat.\nHe demonstrates asking Claude for progress updates, where Claude reads the latest FFmpeg output, calculates remaining time, and reports on bitrate reduction.\nFinally, Claude confirms the process completion and reports the significantly reduced file size (237MB).\nThis showcases a capability (managing long-running, complex local tasks) that typical AI code assistants like Windsurf/Cursor are not designed for.\n\nDemonstration 3: Coding & Development (Live Project):\n\nHe performs a live coding session to demonstrate creating a simple web application from scratch using Claude + MCPs.\nThe goal: a webpage with a full-screen webcam feed that uses MediaPipe for hand gesture detection to allow drawing and erasing on the screen.\nClaude:\n\nCreates a new project folder.\nWrites the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, including necessary library imports.\nOpens the resulting index.html in the browser.\nIteratively refines the application based on his requests: adding a circle cursor for drawing, implementing erasing with an open palm gesture, adjusting cursor/eraser size based on hand distance, removing unwanted features (two-finger mode switching, thumbs-up clearing).\nDemonstrates both full file rewrites and more precise block editing (showing the diff-like instructions it uses).\nSuccessfully implements size scaling for both drawing and erasing based on palm size/distance.\nFinally, initializes a Git repository, creates a .gitignore file, adds files, commits, adds a remote GitHub URL, and pushes the code to the repository.\nHe then manually sets up GitHub Pages to deploy the web app live.\n\n\nConclusions & Future Plans:\n\nEduards concludes that Claude combined with his mCP server offers a more open and flexible environment compared to the more “boxed-in” experience of Windsurf/Cursor, especially for tasks beyond pure code editing within a project context (like system-level tasks, long processes, arbitrary file manipulation).\nThe reduced friction and broader capabilities led him to use Windsurf/Cursor less and less, prompting him to cancel his Windsurf subscription.\nHe acknowledges that Cursor might still be better for users who heavily rely on real-time, inline code auto-completion suggestions, a workflow he doesn’t personally favor.\nFuture plans:\n\nIntegrating a code search tool (mentions “Code Reflex”, possibly typo for CodeGrep or similar) into his mCP server for better code navigation.\nCreating more short videos focused on MCPs.\nInvestigating the new “Claude Code” offering to see what it offers beyond Claude+MCPs, potentially adding matching tools to his server.\nExploring the burgeoning landscape of new LLMs (Groq, Gemini Flash, local models like Phi-3, Gemma 2, DeepSeek) specifically for their tool-using (MCP) capabilities. He finds current platforms lacking and is working on a side project to connect any LLM (API or local) to any MCP for testing, with a particular interest in local models + MCPs for fully offline, private AI workflows.\n\nHe ends with a call to action (subscribe, like, comment, share, Super Thanks).\n\n\n\n\ntitle: Income Stream Surfers: “Desktop Commander” MCP date: 2025-05-04 11:31:27\n:Model Instructions:\n:You: please summarize this video in detail\n\n\n\nAnthropic Cooked AGAIN: RIP CURSOR/CLINE? (CLAUDE DESKTOP UPDATES)\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, here is a detailed summary of the YouTube video “Anthropic Cooked AGAIN: RIP CURSOR/CLINE? (CLAUDE DESKTOP UPDATES)” by Income Stream Surfers:\nIntroduction & Core Announcement:\n\nThe video starts by highlighting a recent update from Anthropic for their Claude AI: the introduction of native support for MCPs (Model Capabilities Platforms, though the speaker initially misnames it) directly within the Claude web/desktop application.\nThis allows users to add and use tools (MCPs) like file system access or process execution directly in the Claude interface, without needing separate applications like Klein or relying solely on API integrations.\nThe speaker specifically focuses on testing the “Desktop Commander” MCP.\nHe also mentions the Claude “Max” plan ($90/month), noting its significantly higher rate limits compared to the Pro plan (5x more usage, approx. 225 messages every 5 hours). He posits that despite the high fixed cost, it could potentially be cheaper for heavy users (like developers building multiple projects) compared to paying per token via the API, which can run into hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\nInstallation & Setup:\n\nThe speaker demonstrates the ease of installing the Desktop Commander MCP. He simply pastes the npx install command provided on the Desktop Commander website directly into the Claude chat window (using the already installed file install MCP to execute it).\nAfter a quick restart of the Claude app, the Desktop Commander MCP appears in the available tools list.\nHe runs into an initial “access denied” error when trying to point the MCP to a specific local project directory. He quickly finds the configuration setting (File &gt; Settings &gt; Developer &gt; Edit Config) and adds the desired path to the allowed directories, resolving the issue.\n\nTesting & Performance:\n\nThe speaker uses one of his standard, complex prompts (available on his School community/channel) to instruct Claude (using the Desktop Commander/native file system MCP) to build a website project within the specified local directory.\nHe expresses strong positive feelings about the integrated workflow within the official Claude app, contrasting it with API interactions or using external tools like Klein or Cursor, which he feels can be “disjointed.” He believes the conversation flow and context passing feel more natural and connected in the official front-end.\nHe speculates that front-end versions of models (like Claude’s or ChatGPT’s) might be inherently more capable or less prone to placeholder code compared to their API counterparts, possibly due to different internal context handling or optimization priorities (API often prioritizes token efficiency).\nA key observation is that Claude, within this setup, successfully generates SVG icons/files, something he notes Klein struggled significantly with.\nThe code generation proceeds smoothly without hitting rate limits during the single project build. He acknowledges needing to press “continue” occasionally when the output gets cut off.\n\nAnalysis & Impressions:\n\nModel Quality: The speaker is highly impressed with the quality of the generated code and especially the design of the resulting website. He calls the design “phenomenal,” “delicious,” and the “best design I’ve ever seen” from an AI coder. He suspects the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model available in the paid front-end might be a less “toned down” or more capable version than the one typically accessed via the API, possibly because the subscribers (likely heavy developers) demand higher quality. He uses OpenRouter usage stats for Sonnet to argue that developer usage dominates API consumption, suggesting Anthropic might optimize the API version for cost, while keeping the front-end version more powerful for subscribers.\nDesktop Commander vs. Native File System: He clarifies later that he’s not 100% certain if the Desktop Commander tool was strictly required or if Claude’s native file system capabilities would have sufficed for writing the files. However, he feels it doesn’t significantly impact his core positive assessment of the overall system (native MCPs, rate limits, model quality in the app). He notes Desktop Commander’s unique ability to run processes (like npm run dev) and view output is cool, but wasn’t the main focus here.\nCost-Effectiveness: He revisits the $90/month cost. Based on the observed rate limits (~225 messages/5 hours) and the complexity of the project generated, he estimates he could build roughly 5 such websites in 5 hours (1 per hour). Comparing this to an estimated $15 API cost per website, the Max plan ($90/month) appears significantly cheaper for anyone building even 6+ similar projects per month.\nErrors: While overwhelmingly positive, he notes the generated project isn’t perfect. He encounters an error when trying to run npm rundev and identifies a couple of other minor issues (text color, syntax errors in an Italian language file). However, he considers these easily fixable and minor compared to the overall quality.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe speaker concludes that this update, combining native MCP support in the Claude app with the Max plan’s high rate limits and the perceived high quality of the model in this environment, makes Claude potentially the “best AI coder on the market.”\nHe finds the results “phenomenal” and “the most impressive AI code” he’s seen, suggesting it surpasses alternatives like Klein and Cursor.\nHe plans to experiment more with this setup and expects to create more content about the Claude desktop app. He believes this development is a significant step forward for AI-assisted coding."

They offer more value than traditional static content (like checklists or courses) by focusing on the application and personalization of knowledge, potentially replacing older lead generation methods and even becoming paid products.\nPrimary Tool & Use Case Demonstrated: “Zoom Ready” Custom GPT\n\nTool: A Custom GPT created by the speaker within the ChatGPT interface.\nUse Case: To help users prepare professionally and efficiently for Zoom calls.\n\nProblem Solved: Automates the process of organizing thoughts, defining goals, and preparing materials for various types of Zoom calls (discovery, internal, etc.), which the speaker found repetitive and time-consuming.\nFunctionality:\n\nTakes user input about the call (attendee, context, user’s service, desired outcome, call length).\nLeverages a pre-loaded “knowledge base” (gathered using deep research tools).\nGenerates a structured preparation guide including: call snapshot, goal, agenda, opening lines, personalized talking points, discovery questions, potential objections, technical/material reminders, and a follow-up email template.\nBonus: Can generate relevant visuals (demonstrated creating a “before and after” graphic using ChatGPT’s built-in image generation).\n\n\n\nTools Used in the Creation Process:\n\nChatGPT:\n\nUse Case: Generating ideas for potential Custom GPTs relevant to the speaker’s audience.\nUse Case: Evaluating those ideas based on user pain points (trouble, time waste, cost).\nUse Case: Scoping the Custom GPT (determining what features are essential vs. too complex).\nUse Case: Crucially, generating the actual prompts and instructions needed to configure the Custom GPT within OpenAI’s builder interface (speaker emphasizes no coding was required, just copy-pasting ChatGPT’s output, including JSON configuration).\nUse Case: Performing deep research to build the knowledge base.\n\nDeep Research Tools: Used to gather comprehensive background information (“knowledge base”) to make the Custom GPT more knowledgeable and effective beyond the standard ChatGPT training data.\n\nTools Mentioned:\n\nPerplexity.ai\nClaude\nGemini 2.5 (specifically its deep research tool)\nChatGPT (as a research tool)\n\nUse Case: Compiling extensive information on the topic (e.g., everything about preparing for Zoom calls – technical, personal, strategic aspects) which is then uploaded to the Custom GPT.\n\nXMind:\n\nTool: Mind mapping software.\nUse Case: Used by the speaker to organize his thoughts and structure the presentation for this video (meta-tool for his process).\n\n\nTools Mentioned as Alternatives or Comparisons:\n\nFirebase Studio (Google):\n\nTool: Platform for building deployable web applications.\nUse Case (Mentioned): An alternative for creating more complex, standalone applications (MicroSaaS) that might require user logins, payment processing, etc., potentially when a Custom GPT’s scope is too limited.\n\nCanva:\n\nTool: Graphic design platform.\nUse Case (Mentioned): Representative of tools used to create traditional lead magnets (infographics, checklists), which the speaker argues are becoming less valuable compared to interactive Custom GPTs.\n\n\nBroader Use Cases for Custom GPTs (Suggested):\n\nLead Magnets: Offer free access to a useful Custom GPT to attract users to a community (like the speaker’s TrainingSites.io) or mailing list.\nPaid Products: Sell access to more advanced or niche Custom GPTs as a revenue stream.\nEducational Tools: Embed within courses or communities to help users apply concepts and get personalized assistance for specific tasks.\nTask Automation: Streamline complex, multi-step workflows for users within a specific domain.\n\n\n:You: please rewrite with focus on Use Cases before tools. I want to get inspiration to use more AI in my daily work\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, let’s focus on the practical applications and problems solved by AI tools as presented in the video, to inspire how you might use AI in your daily work:\nCore Idea: AI, particularly easy-to-create Custom GPTs, can move beyond simple information retrieval and become active assistants that help you apply knowledge and automate multi-step tasks, saving time and improving quality.\nUse Cases Demonstrated & Discussed:\n\nAutomating Complex Routine Preparations:\n\nProblem: Spending repetitive time gathering thoughts, structuring agendas, and tailoring messaging for frequent similar events (like different types of Zoom calls).\nAI Solution: A custom AI agent (“Zoom Ready” Custom GPT) takes basic details about an upcoming call (who, why, duration) and instantly generates a full preparation package: structured agenda, personalized talking points, potential questions, reminders, and even a follow-up email draft.\nTool Used: Custom GPT built on ChatGPT.\nInspiration for You: Think about your recurring tasks that involve preparation, research, and structuring information (e.g., preparing for client meetings, drafting project proposals, planning content, onboarding new team members). Could an AI assistant streamline this?\n\nGenerating and Strategically Evaluating Ideas:\n\nProblem: Needing fresh ideas for content, products, or solutions, and then figuring out which ones are most viable or impactful.\nAI Solution: Using AI to brainstorm a large volume of ideas (e.g., 100 Custom GPT ideas for a specific audience) and then prompting it further to evaluate those ideas based on criteria like solving major pain points, saving time/money, or feasibility.\nTool Used: ChatGPT.\nInspiration for You: Use AI as a brainstorming partner for marketing campaigns, new service offerings, blog post topics, problem-solving approaches, etc. Then, use it again to help you prioritize based on criteria you define.\n\nScoping and Defining Projects/Tools:\n\nProblem: Deciding the right scope for a new tool or project – what’s essential vs. overly complex? Is a simple approach enough, or is a more robust solution needed?\nAI Solution: Asking AI to outline the potential features of a custom tool (like the Zoom GPT), then asking it to compare the pros and cons of building it as a simple AI agent versus a more complex application (like a MicroSaaS using Firebase Studio).\nTool Used: ChatGPT (comparing Custom GPT vs. Firebase Studio).\nInspiration for You: Before starting a project, use AI to explore different implementation options, outline potential features, and get a preliminary analysis of complexity or suitability for different approaches.\n\nBuilding Simple, Custom AI Assistants (Without Code):\n\nProblem: Wanting a specialized AI tool for a specific workflow but lacking coding skills or resources to build a full app.\nAI Solution: Using AI (ChatGPT itself) to generate the necessary instructions and configuration prompts needed to create a new Custom GPT tailored to a specific task. The user just copies and pastes the AI-generated text into the Custom GPT builder.\nTool Used: ChatGPT (to generate prompts for the Custom GPT builder).\nInspiration for You: Identify a niche, repetitive workflow in your job. You could potentially create your own simple Custom GPT assistant for it by having ChatGPT guide you through the setup process.\n\nConducting Deep and Structured Research:\n\nProblem: Needing comprehensive background information on a topic beyond a quick search, compiling information from various angles.\nAI Solution: Using specialized AI research functions to gather in-depth information on a topic (like “preparing for Zoom calls”) from multiple perspectives (technical, personal, strategic). This knowledge then “fuels” the custom AI agent.\nTools Used: Perplexity.ai, Claude, Gemini 2.5, ChatGPT (as research tools).\nInspiration for You: When you need to deeply understand a topic for a report, presentation, or strategy, leverage AI research tools to get comprehensive, structured information faster than traditional searching.\n\nInstantly Creating Relevant Visual Content:\n\nProblem: Needing a quick visual aid (like a diagram or illustration) to complement text or a presentation, without graphic design skills or time.\nAI Solution: Within the workflow of the custom AI agent (the Zoom prep tool), asking it to generate a visual (like a “before and after” graphic related to the call’s topic) directly within the chat interface.\nTool Used: ChatGPT’s built-in image generation (DALL-E).\nInspiration for You: If you need quick illustrations for presentations, documents, or conceptual explanations, try asking an image-generating AI to create them based on your descriptions.\n\nShifting from Static Content to Interactive Applications (Business Use Case):\n\nProblem: Traditional lead magnets (checklists, PDFs) are becoming less effective as AI can generate similar content easily. How to provide unique value?\nAI Solution: Offering interactive Custom GPTs that help users apply information and get personalized results, rather than just consuming static content. This can be used for lead generation (free access) or as paid products.\nTool Used: Custom GPTs.\nInspiration for You: Think about the knowledge you share. Could you turn a passive guide or course module into an interactive AI tool that helps people implement the advice in their specific situation?\n\n\nIn essence, the video showcases AI not just as an information source, but as a dynamic partner for brainstorming, planning, automating personalized workflows, conducting deep research, and even building simple, useful tools without needing to code. Consider the repetitive, information-heavy, or preparation-based tasks in your daily work – there’s likely an AI application that could help streamline them."

The nine key takeaways are:\n\nAgentic Prompting is About Decision Frameworks, Not Step-by-Step Instructions:\n\nOld Approach: Writing massive, overly conditional prompts trying to fit the entire decision tree, edge cases, and explicit tool call parameters into a single prompt. This was like giving step-by-step conditional instructions.\nResult: Constant hallucinations and endless prompt tweaking.\nNew Approach: Hardcode deterministic logic (using if, switch, filter nodes) outside the LLM where possible. Structure and package input data and necessary context (like CRM records, order history) before it hits the LLM. Give the LLM “thinking space” within defined boundaries or “guardrails” (macro objectives, policies, business context). Prompts define how the LLM should make decisions and plan steps, using available tools (which the LLM discovers and uses via appended schemas, not requiring explicit parameter listing in the main prompt).\nLearned: Overspecifying leads to underperformance. Providing “guardrails” and the “why” beats lengthy “how-to” instructions most of the time. Prompts are hypotheses needing testing at scale, not code that can be verified by reading. Emotion (like “ALL CAPS DO NOT”) can heighten LLM attention. Causality with prompts is slippery and hard to debug compared to code.\nExample: A customer success bot saw a 20% improvement in output appropriateness by switching from step-by-step instructions (“if this question, answer this way”) to a framework focusing on the objective (decrease refunds) and providing options/guardrails for the LLM to navigate the conversation and avoid refunds where appropriate.\nRoadmap: Live KPI monitoring and autotriggering A/B prompt tests to continuously improve performance based on metrics (e.g., reducing refund rate from 8% to 7% to 6%). Prompt optimization is challenging due to the slippery nature of causality and LLMs being less effective with negative instructions (“do not do this”).\n\nModel Selection is Crucial for Production Readiness:\n\nOld Approach: Just use the “best” model (initially GPT-4) for simplicity, assuming it works for everything.\nNew Approach: The model choice significantly impacts whether a system is production-ready or just a cool proof-of-concept. Different models (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, DeepMind, Grok) have different strengths (context window size, tool calling ability, conversational style, reasoning). The prompt needs to be dialed in for the specific model.\nLearned: The same prompt can produce a ~20% deviation in output quality depending on the model. Bad outputs don’t always mean a bad prompt or a bad model; it could be the specific combination. Effective prompting techniques differ slightly per model. Long context windows (like Gemini) can sometimes replace Vector DB/RAG for simple data retrieval tasks faster and more accurately. Claude 3.7 Sonnet was good for high-level planning/reasoning (used in a planner/executor/verifier architecture); GPT-4o/5 is good for human-sounding conversational communication.\nRoadmap: Model testing to identify the best model for a scenario before dialing in the prompt. Fine-tuning models for domain-specific jargon/norms (e.g., legal industry) to improve accuracy and reduce the need for excessive scaffolding/guardrails. Standardizing prompting techniques based on both the scenario and the model (requires constant updates as models evolve).\n\nCustom Tooling is Better Than Off-the-Shelf (Usually):\n\nOld Approach: Spending months “tool hopping,” assuming others had already built the necessary solutions. Constantly seeking a “silver bullet” off-the-shelf tool. Imposter syndrome as non-engineers.\nNew Approach: Build custom tools internally for key functions like data processing, labeling, cleaning, API function calling, data retrieval, and prompt engineering. This provides full control, creates more relevant/effective solutions for clients, speeds up iteration cycles, and builds IP. A key focus is building an “agentic database.”\nLearned: Many AI/ML teams face similar roadblocks. Off-the-shelf agentic tools are like SAS – helpful but don’t 100% solve specific needs and force you to bend your architecture to their limitations. Nobody has it completely figured out yet; everyone is “hacking.”\nTakeaway: We are the only ones who know exactly what tools we need for our specific architecture and problems, so we must build them ourselves. It’s also more enjoyable.\nRoadmap: Dynamic tools (flexible, modular API calling based on API research and schemas), prompt evaluation and optimization frameworks, high-volume testing infrastructure (ingesting and processing live/historical data), API research/reference workflow (automating API doc/schema retrieval), and events data processing workflow (mapping user/agent actions over time).\n\nIt’s an Even Playing Field - Skip Traditional Automation:\n\nOld Approach: Assumed most businesses were already using traditional automation (Zapier, Make, RPA) and were ready for AI automation as the next step. Thought AI applications were obvious.\nNew Approach: 70%+ of businesses haven’t touched traditional automation platforms. They often come asking for basic automation. Agentic AI is a completely different paradigm – an “Agentic Operating System” (Agentic OS) that dynamically orchestrates automations and workflows as its tool set. LLMs can build/orchestrate automations themselves.\nLearned: Traditional automation offers 10-30% productivity gains (or maybe 100% operational efficiency if starting from scratch), but it’s 2015 tech. Agentic AI enables AI-first, AI-native systems focused on performance outcomes (KPIs) rather than just system health or task completion. Focusing on traditional automation takes time/resources away from building Agentic systems. Agentic AI is not just an improvement on traditional automation; it’s a paradigm shift.\nTakeaway: Businesses who missed the automation wave should skip directly to Agentic AI. Focus on building Agentic OSs.\nRoadmap: Stop doing traditional automations entirely. Focus only on projects centered around building Agentic systems (e.g., building a Sales Team Agent OS, then a Customer Success Agent OS, aiming for a full business Agentic OS).\n\nPlant Your Flag - Define Your System:\n\nOld Approach: Unsure of their place in the market, novelty of ideas, or common knowledge. Lacked confidence (“imposter syndrome”) and followed market demand, building what clients asked for within their general sandbox. Assumed others had things figured out.\nNew Approach: Gained confidence through experience. Defined their core, long-term winning system: build an “Agentic Database” (centralized, contextual, real-time, easily retrievable single source of truth) first, then build the “Agentic Layer” on top, and integrate “Dynamic Tools.” The primary focus is helping clients define and capture their internal knowledge base and business logic (often trapped in people’s heads or messy spreadsheets) into this database foundation. A business is essentially its data and SOPs (processes).\nLearned: Most people in the space (98% estimated) are copycats, waiting for a playbook. The space is new, everything is a hypothesis (“smoke and mirrors”). Their initial hypothesis about a master contextual database was validated. Their playbook is based on experience and what they see as inevitable trends. Building is key now, not just gathering information.\nRoadmap: Offer “AI Development Blueprints” involving a mandatory discovery process to understand client tech stack, data flow, and knowledge. This allows them to design the database schema, data pipelines, identify agent tasks, and build the prompt framework – boiling down the business logic into the LLM instructions, based on the foundation of well-structured data.\n\nCommunity Building Works Best When Aligned with Your Strengths:\n\nOld Approach: Followed the typical creator playbook (YouTube -&gt; Discord community -&gt; Course). Assumed it would run itself. Found creating tutorials and updating courses felt mandatory, uninspired, and quickly outdated. Set wrong expectations.\nNew Approach: Lean into what is enjoyable and provides value: live interactions (webinars, VIP office hours). Found that learning from community members working on their own projects in different industries significantly accelerated their own understanding. Focus on sharing valuable templates (“super agent templates”) with walkthroughs instead of detailed tutorials. Planning for in-person events.\nLearned: Should have started a focused community sooner. It’s fun, valuable, and accelerates learning. Must be sustainable (align with preferences).\nTakeaway: Don’t blindly copy the creator playbook. Design a community around your personal strengths and preferences; the right people will find it. It’s not about scale, but quality interaction.\nRoadmap: Increase frequency of live hangouts/office hours. Establish a cadence for releasing valuable “super agent templates.” Organize fun events (hackathons, “build of the week” showcases). Integrate embedded agents into their own platform. Move off existing community platforms (like Circle) to build their own platform for more control and a better user experience.\n\nUI/UX is a Massive Bottleneck for Wide Adoption:\n\nOld Approach: Assumed agentic systems would blend seamlessly into existing tools (Slack, Email) without needing a separate UI beyond the workflow builder (n8n).\nNew Approach: UI/UX is the most important factor for widespread adoption. Since agents are performance/KPI-based, they need a dedicated “workspace” or destination. This UI should be seamless, accessible, differentiate the agent system, track its activity, allow human collaboration (monitoring, adjusting, pausing), and clearly display performance KPIs. The relationship should be Human + Agent collaboration, not Master and Tool, enabling siloed accountability (the agent system is responsible for the workflow outcome, not the human for the agent’s specific poor output).\nLearned: Habit change is difficult; users stick to familiar interfaces (like ChatGPT, which succeeded due to its accessible UI). Agentic systems need a similar “UI chip moment” to become frictionless and drive habit change. Trust is an issue; users abandon agents after one failure, unlike forgiving ChatGPT. Current interactions treat agents as tools triggered by humans, hindering true collaboration and widespread use. Personal agents, while easy to build, aren’t widely used because the UI/UX for daily interaction and habit change is missing.\nTakeaway: Unless the system owns the process end-to-end (via its UI/UX and accountability structure), it won’t drive habit change or scale. The crucial collaborative UI between human and agentic entity is the missing piece bottlenecking adoption.\nRoadmap: Actively working on developing this human-agent collaborative UI/UX to unlock wider adoption.\n\nThe ROI Creates an Unstoppable Flywheel:\n\nOld Thought: LLMs are just great tools that multiply individual productivity.\nNew Approach: Focus exclusively on the direct ROI impact measured by KPIs. Agentic systems are performance-based and designed to redefine business outcomes. A business is a machine (Input -&gt; Function -&gt; Output). Agentic systems dramatically decrease the cost of the “Function” (OPEX) while increasing the quality/scale of the “Output” (performance, KPIs).\nLearned: Reducing OPEX and increasing performance (e.g., lower refund rates leading to higher Customer Lifetime Value - LTV) creates a powerful, exponential “flywheel.” Higher LTV means a higher allowable Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), allowing businesses to spend more on marketing and dominate their market share. This creates a massive, self-reinforcing growth loop. This effect is particularly intense right now before Agentic OS becomes the baseline industry standard. CEOs issuing “AI-first” memos understand this potential.\nTakeaway: We are not building process automation; we are building entire operating systems that will redefine industry standard margins. These margins will expand for early adopters before competitors catch up and prices/margins eventually shrink again.\nRoadmap: Implement Agentic OS team-by-team (Sales, CS, Ops) with the long-term vision of building a full business Agentic OS that serves as the foundation for starting or operating a business, providing a massive head start compared to traditional methods.\n\nKnow Your Role as an AI Consultant (or Expert):\n\nOld Approach: Assumed clients/companies consulting with them wanted their broad perspective on the future of AI and felt entitled to challenge their core approach.\nNew Approach: Consult only through the lens of their defined approach (Agentic OS, holistic systems). Put yourself in the client’s shoes and understand their objective for consulting. Are they using you as a test bed to validate their existing idea? Do they want a broad playbook (“be the expert”)? Or do they know what they want to build but need help how to build it (“be the builder”)? Tailor your role accordingly. For large companies, they often want validation or help with a specific piece, not a fundamental pivot suggestion, even if you think their core project is misguided. Protect time for internal projects; don’t consult on projects you believe are fundamentally the wrong approach unless it aligns with your own path or is part of a structured engagement like their discovery process.\nLearned: Clients have different needs and expectations for a consultant. Understanding their objective defines your role (helper, expert, builder). Don’t waste time pushing your full vision on those who aren’t ready or asking for it; focus that energy on those who are interested in your core approach or on building your own products.\nTakeaway: To be an effective AI consultant, understand the client’s objective and mindset to determine your appropriate role in that scenario.\nRoadmap: Develop a structured discovery process for clients genuinely interested in implementing Agentic OS (this naturally includes consulting). Accept speaking/consulting engagements specifically about their holistic approach (Agentic OS, paradigm shift) rather than general AI automation. Decline consulting on individual alpha/beta projects that don’t align with their core strategy.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the presenter emphasizes the shift from traditional automation and simple AI tools to building comprehensive, performance-driven Agentic Operating Systems layered on robust, centralized data. This requires a change in mindset regarding prompting, model selection, tool building, and business strategy, leading to a powerful, exponential growth flywheel for early adopters, and necessitates a focused approach to consulting and community building."

    "section": "",
    "text": ":Model Instructions:\n\n:You: please summarize this video in detail\n\n\n\nMsty Studio - Toolsets\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, here is a detailed summary of the Msty Studio Toolsets video:\nIntroduction & Core Concept:\n\nThe video introduces a powerful feature in Msty Studio called “Toolbox” (also referred to as tools or toolsets).\nThis feature allows Large Language Models (LLMs) within Msty Studio to interact with external “tools” installed on the user’s machine.\nCrucially, this feature relies entirely on the “Sidecar” component, which must be running and connected. The Sidecar powers the execution of these tools. (Users are urged to watch the previous video about Sidecar).\nThese tools enable communication with various external systems: data sources, file systems, GitHub repositories, web search, databases (like MySQL, SQLite), Google Drive, etc. They can provide context (like file lists or data) to the LLM and perform actions (like writing files, creating directories, executing commands).\nThe technology underpinning this is the Model Context Protocol (MCP), developed by Anthropic (Claude’s creator). Msty Studio provides an interface to leverage this protocol.\n\nMsty Studio’s Approach & Advantages:\n\nWhile other applications might use MCP, Msty Studio offers a unique, browser-based approach.\nUsers don’t need a separate desktop application (like Claude’s official one) to manage or use these tools.\nConfiguration and management are designed to be straightforward.\nThe Sidecar can run anywhere (locally or on a remote server), allowing users to connect from the browser-based Msty Studio and access powerful tools without needing them installed directly on their local client machine.\nVision for the Future: The presenter envisions scenarios where users can create toolsets and assign them to specific users or teams (e.g., giving controlled tool access to family members like children or parents) without requiring them to manage installations, promoting accessibility.\n\nLimitations:\n\nTools currently do not work well with local LLMs. This is presented as a limitation of the underlying models/protocols regarding streaming during tool use, not Msty Studio itself. Online models (like Claude models demonstrated) work much better.\n\nSetup and Configuration:\n\nConnect Sidecar: Ensure the Sidecar is running. Copy its local endpoint URL and token into the Msty Studio connection settings and save the connection info. A successful connection is indicated by a bolt icon.\nAccess Toolbox: Navigate to the “Toolbox” section in Msty Studio.\nAdding Tools:\n\nImport Default Tools: Msty Studio provides an option to import a set of pre-defined common tools to get started (e.g., Search, File System, Git, GitHub, Mac OS commands).\nDisclaimer: Msty does not provide, maintain, or support these tools. Users add and run them at their own risk. Msty cannot help with setting up specific tool dependencies or arguments beyond the platform integration.\nManual Addition: Users can add their own tools by finding MCP server configurations (often available on GitHub in official or community repositories like “awesome-mcp-servers”). This involves providing a Tool ID, optionally an icon, and the tool’s JSON configuration (specifying command, arguments, placeholders, environment variables).\nDependencies: Most tools require dependencies like Node.js, Python (often with package managers like npx or uv), or Docker. The Toolbox interface shows required dependencies and indicates if they are detected via the Sidecar connection (showing red if missing or disconnected).\n\nTool Parameters:\n\nIndividual tools can have default parameters set (e.g., a default API key for Brave search, default host/port/user for MySQL).\n\nCreating Toolsets:\n\nThis is a key concept. Users create named “Toolsets,” which are collections of one or more tools configured for a specific purpose. This is similar to “Knowledge Stacks” in the Msty App.\nWithin a specific Toolset, users can override the default parameters of a tool or provide specific ones needed only for that toolset (e.g., setting a specific allowed_directory for the File System tool, or providing production database credentials for a MySQL tool in one toolset and development credentials in another).\nToolsets can be reordered to set preference if multiple toolsets containing similar tools are selected.\n\n\nDemonstration:\n\nThe presenter connects the Sidecar.\nImports the default tools.\nShows the configuration details for tools like MySQL, demonstrating how to add default parameters (host, port, user).\nCreates multiple Toolsets:\n\nOne combining MySQL and Google Search.\nOne for “Prod MySQL” with specific overridden parameters (host, password, database name).\n\nDemonstrates creating a custom tool (“my own SQL”) by copying JSON configuration from an online source and defining placeholders for arguments and environment variables.\nMain Demo (Mac OS & File System):\n\nCreates toolsets: Mac OS info (using a Mac OS tool) and Mac OS FS tool (combining Mac OS and File System tools).\nSelects the Mac OS info toolset and uses an online Claude model to ask about the Mac’s CPU and disk information. The LLM successfully uses the tool via Sidecar to retrieve this system info.\nConfigures the Mac OS FS tool toolset, specifically setting the allowed_directories parameter for the File System tool to point to a local documentation folder.\nSelects the Mac OS FS tool toolset.\nAsks the LLM what files/folders it can see in the configured directory. It correctly lists them.\nAsks the LLM to create a new directory (“demo”) within the allowed path. The directory is successfully created on the file system.\nAsks the LLM to write the CPU information (obtained via the Mac OS tool) into a file cpu.txt within the demo directory (handled by the File System tool). This demonstrates combining multiple tools within a conversation flow.\n\n\nSummary & Conclusion:\n\nToolbox is a feature for integrating external tools using Sidecar and MCP.\nUsers can manage tools, set default parameters, and create specific “Toolsets” by combining tools and overriding parameters for specific tasks.\nRequires Sidecar and works best with online models.\nMsty Studio provides the platform but not the tools themselves.\nMsty Studio remains browser-based with local data storage.\nThe presenter mentions a forthcoming “Live Context” feature to be shown in the next video.\n\n\n\n\ntitle: Msty Studio Sidecar date: 2025-05-04 18:39:27\n\n:Model Instructions:\n:You: please summarize this video in detail\n\n\n\nMsty Studio - Sidecar\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, here is a detailed summary of the Msty Studio Sidecar video:\nIntroduction & Purpose of Sidecar\n\nThe video introduces “Sidecar,” described as an optional but very important feature for Msty Studio.\nMsty Studio Context: Msty Studio is a web application that runs in a browser on various devices. While flexible, being a web app means it operates within a browser sandbox, limiting its ability to access local machine resources, run commands, or directly fetch certain external data (like YouTube transcripts) due to security restrictions (e.g., CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).\nSidecar’s Role: Sidecar acts as a “helper app” or a small, dedicated backend for Msty Studio. It’s a separate application installed and run on a user’s desktop machine (Windows, Linux, Mac) or potentially a remote server.\nWhy Needed: It bridges the gap between the limited web environment of Msty Studio and the capabilities of a local machine, enabling features that Msty Studio alone cannot perform.\nOptionality: Msty Studio functions without Sidecar, but specific advanced features are only activated when Sidecar is running and connected.\n\nHow Sidecar Works & Setup\n\nInstallation: Users download and install the Sidecar application on a chosen machine.\nInterface: Currently shown as a menubar application (not a full chat interface). It provides options to manage the Sidecar service.\nConnection Details:\n\nLocal Endpoint: Provides a local network address (URL) for Msty Studio to connect to.\nToken: A security token is required for Msty Studio to authenticate with Sidecar. This token can be copied from the Sidecar menu.\nRegenerate Token: Tokens are regenerated each time Sidecar starts for security.\nQuit: Option to stop the Sidecar service.\n\nConnecting from Msty Studio:\n\nUsers go to the connection settings in Msty Studio.\nThey input the Sidecar’s endpoint URL and the current authentication token.\nThere’s an option to save the connection info (though the token needs updating if Sidecar restarts).\n\n\nSecurity Features\n\nAuthentication: Connection requires a valid, current token.\nToken Regeneration: Tokens change on restart, preventing unauthorized use of old tokens.\nDomain Restriction (CORS Hardcoding): Sidecar will be hardcoded to only accept connections from the official Msty Studio domain (e.g., mystudio.com). Random websites cannot connect to it.\nHTTPS: Connections are expected to use HTTPS for security.\nUser Control: The user must explicitly run the Sidecar application.\n\nTunneling Feature\n\nProblem: To connect to Sidecar from a different device (like a phone or iPad) not on the same local network, the localhost or local IP address isn’t sufficient.\nSolution: Sidecar includes an optional “Tunneling” feature.\nMechanism: When enabled, it uses Cloudflare’s tunneling service to create a secure (HTTPS), public URL that forwards traffic to the local Sidecar instance.\nBenefit: Makes it easy for users (even non-technical ones) to access Sidecar’s features from any device, anywhere, without complex network configuration.\nSecurity Note: This involves routing traffic through Cloudflare; users who prefer not to can keep tunneling disabled. Connection still requires the token and is restricted by domain.\n\nDemonstrated Functionality: YouTube Transcripts\n\nChallenge: Web applications like Msty Studio typically cannot directly fetch YouTube transcripts due to browser security and CORS policies enforced by YouTube.\nSidecar Solution: Msty Studio delegates the task to Sidecar. Sidecar, running as a local application, is not bound by the browser’s sandbox and can fetch the webpage and extract the transcript data.\nDemo: The presenter adds a YouTube video URL as an attachment in Msty Studio. Sidecar (connected) fetches the transcript in the background. The presenter then successfully chats with the video’s content (“Summarize this for me”), proving the transcript was retrieved and used as context.\n\nFuture Potential & Vision\n\nLocal AI Integration: A major future plan is to embed local AI services like Ollama directly within Sidecar. This would allow users to run local AI models accessible via Msty Studio without needing separate complex setups. Msty Studio might even manage models through Sidecar.\nService-Based: Sidecar might evolve from a UI application to a background service, suitable for running on servers without a graphical interface.\nMore Powerful Features: The presenter emphasizes that Sidecar enables many powerful features, and more capabilities will be added and demonstrated over time (e.g., potentially improved real-time data fetching, though web search scraping is noted as fragile).\nStability: Sidecar itself is envisioned as a relatively stable component that won’t require frequent updates, unlike a desktop application.\n\nMsty Studio vs. Msty App Clarification & Licensing\n\nThe presenter explicitly clarifies that Msty Studio (the web app) is a completely different application from the existing Msty App (the desktop application). While some features overlap, they serve different purposes (web/mobile/team access for Studio vs. desktop power for App).\nLicensing Bonus: As a gesture, users with an Orum license for the Msty App desktop application will be granted access to Msty Studio as well (limited to one activation to prevent misuse).\n\nIn essence, Sidecar is a crucial companion app for Msty Studio, overcoming web application limitations to unlock advanced features like local resource access, external data fetching (YouTube transcripts), and future capabilities like integrated local AI, all while maintaining security through tokens and domain restrictions.\n\n\n\ntitle: Msty Studio - Local AI with Sidecar date: 2025-05-04 20:24:20\n\n:Model Instructions:\n:You: please summarize this video in detail\n\n\n\nMsty Studio - Local AI with Sidecar\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, here is a detailed summary of the YouTube video “Msty Studio - Local AI with Sidecar”:\nCore Problem & Msty Studio’s Goal:\nThe video addresses concerns from users that Msty Studio (a web-based application for interacting with large language models) might make using local AI models difficult, especially for newcomers. The presenter aims to demonstrate that Msty Studio, particularly with its companion app “Sidecar,” actually simplifies the process of setting up and using local AI.\nMsty Studio Basics (Web App):\n\nMsty Studio itself is a web application, meaning users don’t need to install anything to use it if they are connecting to online AI providers like OpenAI, OpenRouter, etc. This makes it easy for teams, classrooms, or individuals to try LLMs without installation hurdles.\n\nIntroducing Sidecar (for Local AI):\n\nFor users who do want to run AI models locally on their own hardware, Msty provides a separate downloadable application called “Sidecar.”\nSidecar is presented as the recommended starting point for anyone new to local AI who wants to use it with Msty Studio. It guides users through the setup process.\n\nSidecar First-Run Demonstration:\n\nInitial Launch: When a new user runs Sidecar for the first time, it presents setup options for local AI.\nSetup Options:\n\nIt detects if the user already has models from the standalone Msty App or Ollama installed and offers to use those.\nCrucially, it offers to “Set up local AI.” The presenter chooses this option.\n\nAutomated Setup: Sidecar then automatically handles the download and configuration of the necessary components to run local AI. It sets this up as an isolated instance, even if the user has other local AI setups (like the Msty App), ensuring it runs on its own port without conflict.\nConnecting to Msty Studio: Once the setup is complete, Sidecar provides options:\n\nCopy the local AI endpoint URL (for manual configuration).\nA button labeled “Start using in Msty Studio,” which is highlighted as the convenient option for new users.\n\nSeamless Integration: Clicking the button automatically opens Msty Studio in the web browser and connects it to the local AI endpoint managed by Sidecar. The presenter demonstrates this by immediately starting a chat with the default local model.\n\nBeyond Setup: Model Management via Msty Studio:\n\nThe video emphasizes that Sidecar’s utility extends beyond the initial setup. Msty Studio’s “Model Hub” feature leverages the connection established by Sidecar (or any compatible endpoint) for managing models.\nConnecting to Providers: In the Model Hub, users first select the AI provider they want to manage. In the demo, this is the local AI instance set up by Sidecar. The presenter notes you could also add and manage remote AI endpoints (e.g., a powerful server elsewhere) through this interface.\nManaging Models: Once connected to a provider (like the local Sidecar one), users can:\n\nInstall Featured Models: Browse and install curated models (e.g., Gemma 3, TinyLlama).\nView Installed Models: See a list of all models currently available on that endpoint.\nInstall Ollama Models: Search and install models directly from the Ollama library (demonstrated with Llama 3.2).\nInstall Hugging Face Models: Mentioned as a capability (search and install).\nInstall Custom Ollama Models: Paste the name/tag of any model from Ollama Hub (demonstrated with codellama:7b-instruct-fp16) to download and install it.\nMonitor Downloads: A progress indicator shows active downloads, which can be paused and resumed.\n\n\nClarification on Sidecar Necessity:\n\nWhile Sidecar provides the easiest setup experience, the presenter clarifies that you don’t strictly need Sidecar running just to manage models in the Model Hub. Any Ollama-compatible endpoint (including one run by the standalone Msty App or Ollama itself) can be added and managed through Msty Studio’s Model Hub.\n\nUpcoming Feature: Local AI Settings Management:\n\nA future feature teased is the ability to manage the settings of the local AI server directly from Msty Studio (e.g., restart the server, configure CORS headers, add authentication).\nCrucially, this upcoming settings management feature will require Sidecar to be installed and running, as the web app itself cannot directly modify local server configurations without it.\n\nConclusion:\nThe video concludes by reiterating that Sidecar makes getting started with local AI in Msty Studio very easy, aligning with their priority of user-friendliness, especially for newcomers. It provides a guided setup and enables powerful model management features directly within the Msty Studio web interface, with further local server controls planned that will leverage Sidecar.\n\n\n\ntitle: Msty Studio - Turnstiles date: 2025-05-04 20:29:30\n\n:Model Instructions:\n\n:You: please summarize this video in detail\n\n\n\nMsty Studio - Turnstiles\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, here is a detailed summary of the Msty Studio - Turnstiles YouTube video:\nIntroduction & Core Concept\n\nThe video introduces “Turnstiles,” presented as arguably the most advanced and powerful feature in Msty Studio to date.\nAt its core, Turnstiles allow users to queue multiple messages (prompts) and have them sent to the AI model in sequence.\nThe speaker emphasizes that while basic queuing exists in other apps, Msty Studio’s implementation goes much further, particularly through the composition of “add-ons.”\n\nBasic Queuing & Management\n\nAdding Messages:\n\nUsers can type a message and click the “Turnstile” icon (or use Alt+Click on the icon) to add it to the queue.\nExample: Adding “Hi,” then “hello,” then “tell me something interesting.”\n\nRunning the Queue: Clicking “Run” sends the messages sequentially. The AI responds to each message before the next one is sent.\nAlternative Input (Syntax):\n\nUsers can define multiple messages directly in the input box using ---m as a separator between messages.\nExample: Hi ---m hello ---m tell me something interesting\n\nQueue Management UI:\n\nOnce messages are in the queue (visible in a side panel), users can:\n\nReorder: Drag and drop messages to change the sequence.\nSkip: Toggle a switch to skip specific messages during execution.\n\n\n\nAdvanced Queue Commands (Syntax-based)\n\nSpecial syntax can be used at the end of a multi-message input block:\n\n---r [number]: Regenerate the last message in the sequence [number] additional times. (Example: ---r 2 means the last message runs, then regenerates twice more, for a total of 3 executions of that step). This mimics the standard regenerate function but within the sequence.\n---c [number]: Continue the generation for the last message [number] times. This is useful if a response gets cut off due to token limits. (Example: ---c 4 with a low max token limit shows the AI continuing its thought over multiple calls).\n\nState Snapshot: When a message is added to the queue (either via UI or syntax), it takes a snapshot of the current settings (selected model, parameters like max tokens, temperature, etc.) for that specific step.\n\nSaving & Loading Turnstiles\n\nUsers can save the current queue configuration (including all steps and their individual settings) as a named “Turnstile.”\nSaved Turnstiles can be loaded later, even in different chat sessions, repopulating the queue exactly as it was saved.\nThis allows users to reuse complex sequences easily.\n\nAdvanced Turnstile Editing & Add-on Composition (The Core Power)\n\nA dedicated Turnstile management UI allows detailed editing of saved Turnstiles.\nPer-Step Customization: The key power lies in customizing each individual step within the Turnstile sequence independently. For each step, users can:\n\nSelect a different AI model.\nChange parameters (temperature, tokens, etc.).\nEnable/disable attachments (documents, YouTube links).\nEnable/disable real-time web data access.\nAdd specific Toolsets.\nEnable/disable Live Context.\n\nThis allows for highly complex workflows, like using one step for research with web access, another step for summarization with a different model, and a third step for creative writing.\n\nIntegrating Personas\n\nPersonas (pre-defined agent configurations in Msty Studio) can be added as steps within a Turnstile sequence.\nExample: A Turnstile asks an AI about an interesting animal, and the next step in the Turnstile is a “Poet” persona tasked with writing a poem about the animal described in the previous step’s response.\nThis further enhances the composability, as Personas themselves can have unique models, tools, system prompts, etc.\n\nLooping/Repeating Turnstiles\n\nA small # icon in the Turnstile queue panel allows users to set a number.\nThis number dictates how many times the entire Turnstile sequence will run in a loop.\nExample: A 2-step Turnstile set to run 5 times will execute Step 1 -&gt; Step 2 -&gt; Step 1 -&gt; Step 2… for a total of 5 full cycles.\nWarning: The speaker explicitly warns that this feature can be powerful but potentially very expensive (in terms of API costs), especially when complex add-ons or many steps are involved. It’s presented as a “chainsaw” – powerful but requires caution. The feature is slightly hidden by default (set to run once).\n\nExport & Import\n\nTurnstiles, including all their steps, configurations, and even attached files, can be exported and imported, allowing users to share complex workflows.\n\nConclusion\nThe Turnstiles feature transforms Msty Studio from a simple chat interface into a powerful automation and workflow tool, allowing users to sequence AI interactions, customize each step with various add-ons (models, tools, data sources, personas), save/load these sequences, and even loop them for repeated tasks. The emphasis is on the composability and flexibility offered by this system.\n\n\n\ntitle: Msty Studio using SearXNG date: 2025-05-04 20:34:51\n\n:Model Instructions:\n\n:You: please summarize this video in detail\n\n\n\nPrivate searches in Msty Studio using SearXNG\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, here is a detailed summary of the YouTube video “Private searches in Msty Studio using SearXNG”:\nIntroduction & Problem:\nThe video introduces a new feature in Msty Studio: the ability to use SearXNG as a real-time data search provider. This aligns with the Msty ecosystem’s focus on privacy, as SearXNG allows users to have full control over their search mechanism, keeping searches private. The presenter notes the potential ambiguity in pronouncing “SearXNG” (suggesting “Searx-N-G” based on its origin as a fork of Searx with “NG” for Next Generation).\nSetup Options & Focus:\nThere are two main ways to set up SearXNG: installing it locally or hosting it on a server. The video focuses on the second option: setting up SearXNG on a user-owned server and connecting it to Msty Studio. A disclaimer is given that the video won’t cover every detail of provisioning a Virtual Private Server (VPS) or installing all base dependencies, directing viewers to the official SearXNG documentation (docs.searxng.org) for more comprehensive installation guides.\nInstallation Method & Tools:\n\nThe presenter recommends using Docker for installation, citing issues encountered with the standard installation script (specifically around Redis installation on Ubuntu) at the time of recording.\nKey prerequisites for the server setup are Docker and a web server like Nginx (especially for enabling HTTPS/SSL).\nThe presenter briefly mentions using a server management tool called “Cleaver” and a VPS provider like “Vultr” to quickly provision a server with necessary components like Docker, Nginx, and SSL pre-configured. The SearXNG instance is configured to listen on port 8080.\n\nSearXNG Installation via Docker (Terminal Steps):\nThe presenter demonstrates the setup process via a terminal connected to the provisioned server, closely following the SearXNG Docker documentation:\n\nAdds a new user (searxng).\nChanges directory (cd) into the user’s directory.\nSets the export port variable (export PORT=8080).\nPulls the SearXNG Docker project/image.\nRuns the SearXNG Docker container using commands copied from the documentation.\nVerifies the container is running using docker ps.\n\nSearXNG Configuration:\nAfter installation, specific configuration changes are needed within the settings.yml file located in the SearXNG directory (likely mounted from the container):\n\nEnable JSON Format:\n\nThe presenter first demonstrates (using curl command from the server’s terminal) that requesting search results with format=json initially results in a 403 Forbidden error because JSON output is disabled by default. Removing the format parameter returns HTML successfully.\nTo fix this, the settings.yml file is edited (using vim). Under the search: section, within formats:, json is added to the list alongside html.\n\nConfigure CORS Headers:\n\nTo prevent Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors when Msty Studio tries to query the SearXNG instance from the browser, specific HTTP headers need to be added in settings.yml (likely under a server: section’s header settings).\nThe presenter adds three Access-Control-Allow-* headers:\n\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: Specifically mentioning misty.studio (and potentially others like the server’s own domain).\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: Allowing GET, POST, OPTIONS.\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Allowing Content-Type, X-Requested-With.\n\nIt’s emphasized that without these CORS settings, the integration will fail.\n\nRestart Container: After saving changes to settings.yml, the Docker container needs to be restarted using docker container restart &lt;container_id&gt;.\nVerification: The presenter re-runs the curl command requesting JSON format (format=json) and confirms that it now successfully returns search results in JSON format instead of the 403 error.\n\nIntegration with Msty Studio:\n\nThe presenter copies the HTTPS URL of their hosted SearXNG instance.\nBack in Msty Studio, they right-click the “real-time data globe” icon.\nThey select the “Use SearXNG” option.\nThey paste the copied SearXNG instance URL into the provided endpoint field.\n\nTesting the Integration:\n\nA question requiring real-time data is asked within Msty Studio.\nA response is successfully received.\nThe real-time data sources listed in the response are expanded, confirming that results were fetched via the configured SearXNG instance.\n\nConclusion:\nThe video concludes by confirming that the setup is successful. Users can now leverage their private, self-hosted SearXNG instance for real-time data searches within Msty Studio, enhancing privacy and control."

    "text": ":Model Instructions:\n\n:You: please summarize this video in detail\n\n\n\nMetas AI Boss Says He DONE With LLMS…\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, here is a detailed summary of the YouTube video “Metas AI Boss Says He DONE With LLMS…” hosted by TheAIGRID, focusing on Yann LeCun’s statements at Nvidia GTC 2025:\nIntroduction & Core Statement:\n\nThe video centers around a statement made by Yann LeCun (Meta’s Chief AI Scientist, considered a “godfather of AI”) at Nvidia GTC 2025: “I’m not so interested in LLMs anymore.”\nThe host highlights the significance of this statement coming from someone with LeCun’s expertise, especially given the current hype surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nLeCun’s Reasoning for Moving Beyond LLMs:\n\nLLMs are Maturing, Not the Frontier: LeCun views current LLM development as more incremental, focusing on scaling data, compute, and using synthetic data – tasks now handled by “industry product people.” He believes the truly exciting research questions lie elsewhere.\nLimitations of Token Prediction:\n\nLLMs fundamentally work by predicting the next discrete token from a finite dictionary (e.g., ~100,000 tokens). This works for text but is ill-suited for understanding the high-dimensional, continuous nature of the real world (like video).\nTrying to predict video at the pixel level fails because much of the world is unpredictable in detail (e.g., the exact appearance of people in a room). Models waste resources trying to predict these unpredictable details.\nTechniques based on reconstructing images/videos from corrupted versions haven’t performed as well as alternative methods.\n\nSimplistic Reasoning: While efforts exist to make LLMs reason, LeCun believes this approach is “simplistic.” He argues true human reasoning and planning occur in an abstract mental space, independent of language (e.g., mentally rotating a cube, a cat planning a jump). Reasoning shouldn’t be confined to manipulating discrete tokens.\n\nLeCun’s Four Key Areas of Future Focus:\nLeCun is more interested in research focusing on: 1. Understanding the Physical World: How machines can build internal models of reality (World Models). 2. Persistent Memory: Giving AI systems memory comparable to humans. 3. Reasoning: Developing more fundamental reasoning capabilities beyond token manipulation. 4. Planning: Enabling AI to plan sequences of actions to achieve goals based on its world model and reasoning.\nWorld Models & The JEPA Architecture:\n\nWorld Models: LeCun emphasizes the need for AI to have internal world models, similar to humans, which allow prediction and understanding of physical interactions (e.g., knowing pushing a bottle at the top vs. bottom yields different results).\nAbstract Representation: The key is not to predict raw data (like pixels) but to learn abstract representations of the world and make predictions within that abstract space.\nJEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures): This is LeCun’s proposed architecture.\n\nNon-Generative: Unlike models trying to generate every pixel, JEPA focuses on learning meaningful representations.\nPredicts in Abstract Space: It learns by predicting missing or masked parts of input (like video) within its learned abstract representation, not at the pixel level.\nEfficiency: By discarding irrelevant information, it’s more efficient.\nV-JEPA (Video JEPA): A version trained on video. An upcoming Version 2 shows promise.\nExample: V-JEPA can reportedly assess the physical plausibility of a video. By tracking prediction error in its abstract space while viewing a video, it detects anomalies (like objects unnaturally disappearing or defying physics) because they deviate from the patterns learned from normal videos.\n\n\nSystem 1 vs. System 2 Thinking:\n\nLeCun relates his ideas to the psychological concepts of System 1 (fast, intuitive, reactive thinking – like experienced driving) and System 2 (slow, deliberate, planning-based thinking – like learning to drive, involving a world model).\nHe suggests current AI (including LLMs) is good at System 1-like tasks but fundamentally lacks robust System 2 capabilities.\nHe believes a different architecture (like JEPA) is needed to achieve true System 2 reasoning and planning, which is essential for more advanced AI. Eventually, tasks learned via System 2 can become compiled into faster System 1 policies.\n\nPath to AGI & Data Needs:\n\nLeCun argues strongly that AGI cannot be achieved solely through text data.\nHe makes a quantitative comparison: The amount of text data LLMs are trained on (~10^14 bytes, taking humans ~400,000 years to read) is comparable to the amount of visual data a 4-year-old child processes (~10^14 bytes).\nThis implies that learning from rich, multi-modal sensory input, especially related to the physical world, is crucial and far more data-dense than text alone.\n\nHost’s Commentary & Conclusion:\n\nThe host finds LeCun’s points compelling, noting that LLMs’ limitations in physical world understanding have been echoed in other research (mentioning a Chinese paper on Sora-like models).\nHe agrees with the likely future direction towards hybrid or “omnimodel” systems that integrate different capabilities, as Google is already exploring.\nThe conclusion is that while LLMs are powerful, LeCun presents a strong case that they are not the endpoint and that architectures like JEPA, focused on world models and abstract representation learning, represent a more promising path towards AGI and understanding the physical world."

I have no medical issues to consider when making my diet.\nPlease make me a diet and give me the following food recommendations. After each recommendation you write in parenthesis why you recommend the food.\n\nTop 30 foods to eat and Please categorise the Top 30 foods to eat in: 1. Proteins and Fats 2. Vegetables 3. Complex Carbs and Others\nTop 10 foods only to eat in small quantities\nTop 10 foods to avoid\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, I understand your goals for creating a personalized diet plan focused on low insulin impact, anti-inflammatory properties, with low to moderate meat intake and flexibility. Based on the provided context and general nutritional principles aligned with your objectives, here is a systemized list of food recommendations.\nThe emphasis is on choosing whole foods and balanced eating patterns rather than strict macronutrient ratios [1]. A healthy eating plan involves understanding both what to eat and appropriate portion sizes [5][2]. By selecting suitable foods, you can aim to manage blood sugar levels and potentially reduce insulin resistance [3][8]. Meals should ideally incorporate a balance of carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats [7]. Reducing intake of saturated fats and added sugars is also recommended [2].\nHere are the food recommendations based on your goals:\nTop 30 Foods to Eat\nThis list prioritizes foods known for their lower glycemic impact, anti-inflammatory properties, nutrient density, and suitability for a diet with moderate meat consumption.\n1. Proteins and Fats:\n\nSalmon: (Rich in anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids, high-quality protein)\nSardines: (Excellent source of omega-3s, calcium, and protein)\nChicken Breast (skinless): (Lean protein source)\nTurkey Breast (skinless): (Very lean protein source)\nEggs: (Complete protein, contains choline and healthy fats - moderation advised by some, but generally beneficial)\nLentils: (Excellent source of plant-based protein, high fiber, low glycemic index)\nChickpeas: (Good source of plant-based protein and fiber)\nTofu/Tempeh: (Versatile plant-based protein sources, derived from soy)\nAvocado: (Rich in monounsaturated fats, fiber, anti-inflammatory compounds)\nOlive Oil (Extra Virgin): (High in monounsaturated fats and antioxidants, anti-inflammatory)\nNuts (Almonds, Walnuts): (Provide healthy fats, protein, fiber, and anti-inflammatory compounds - portion control needed)\nSeeds (Chia, Flax, Hemp): (Rich in fiber, omega-3s (ALA), and protein)\n\n2.

Complex Carbs and Others:\n\nQuinoa: (Complete protein, good source of fiber, whole grain [4])\nOats (Rolled or Steel-Cut): (High in soluble fiber, particularly beta-glucan, helps manage blood sugar, whole grain [4])\nBrown Rice: (Whole grain providing fiber and nutrients [4])\nBerries (Blueberries, Strawberries, Raspberries): (Low glycemic index, high in antioxidants and fiber)\nCitrus Fruits (Oranges, Grapefruits): (Good source of Vitamin C and fiber, can support insulin sensitivity [4])\nApples: (Source of fiber, particularly pectin)\nSweet Potatoes: (Source of fiber and vitamins, lower glycemic index than white potatoes – portion control is key)\nBeans (Black, Kidney): (High in fiber and plant-based protein, low glycemic index)\nHerbs & Spices (Turmeric, Ginger, Cinnamon): (Contain potent anti-inflammatory compounds)\n\nTop 10 Foods to Eat Only in Small Quantities\nThese foods can fit into a healthy diet but should be consumed moderately due to calorie density, natural sugar content, or potential impact on blood sugar or inflammation if eaten in excess. Managing portion sizes is important [2][5].\n\nRed Meat (Lean Cuts): (Source of protein, iron, B12, but higher in saturated fat than poultry/fish and linked to inflammation in large amounts)\nCheese: (Source of protein and calcium, but can be high in saturated fat and sodium [2])\nHigher-Sugar Fruits (Mango, Pineapple, Grapes): (Provide vitamins and fiber, but have a higher natural sugar content)\nDried Fruit (Raisins, Dates): (Concentrated source of sugar and calories, though they do contain fiber)\nPotatoes (White): (Starchy vegetable, can significantly raise blood sugar if eaten plain or in large portions)\nCorn: (Starchy vegetable, often genetically modified, higher glycemic impact than non-starchy vegetables)\nHoney/Maple Syrup: (Natural sugars, still impact blood sugar, use very sparingly as sweeteners)\nWhole Wheat Bread/Pasta: (Better than refined grains, but still processed and can impact blood sugar – choose 100% whole grain and control portions)\nDark Chocolate (70%+ cacao): (Contains antioxidants and some health benefits, but also sugar and calories)\nNatural Nut Butters: (Healthy fats and protein, but very calorie-dense)\n\nTop 10 Foods to Avoid\nThese foods are generally discouraged as they can significantly spike insulin levels, promote inflammation, and offer little nutritional value. Reducing added sugars and unhealthy fats is key [2].\n\nSugary Drinks (Soda, Sweetened Teas, Fruit Juices): (High in added sugars [2], cause rapid blood sugar spikes)\nRefined Grains (White Bread, White Pasta, White Rice): (Stripped of fiber and nutrients, lead to quick blood sugar increases)\nProcessed Snacks (Chips, Crackers, Cookies): (Often high in refined carbs, unhealthy fats, sodium [2], and added sugars [2])\nProcessed Meats (Sausages, Hot Dogs, Deli Meats): (High in sodium, preservatives, and unhealthy fats; linked to inflammation)\nFried Foods: (High in unhealthy fats, calories, and potentially trans fats)\nPastries and Baked Goods: (Typically high in refined flour, sugar [2], and unhealthy fats [2])\nSugary Cereals: (High in added sugar [2] and refined carbohydrates)\nFoods with Trans Fats (Partially Hydrogenated Oils): (Strongly linked to inflammation and heart disease)\nExcessive Alcohol: (Can interfere with blood sugar control and contribute empty calories)\nSauces/Condiments with High Added Sugar/Sodium: (Ketchup, some salad dressings, BBQ sauce – check labels carefully [2])\n\nRemember, this is a general guideline based on your stated goals. Individual needs may vary [6][8]. Focusing on whole, unprocessed foods and balanced meal composition [7] will support your aim for a low-insulin, anti-inflammatory diet with moderate meat intake.\n\n:You: Please translate your answer in danish\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, jeg forstår dine mål med at skabe en personlig kostplan fokuseret på lav insulinpåvirkning, antiinflammatoriske egenskaber, med lavt til moderat kødindtag og fleksibilitet. Baseret på den givne kontekst og generelle ernæringsprincipper, der stemmer overens med dine mål, er her en systematiseret liste over fødevareanbefalinger.\nVægten ligger på at vælge hele fødevarer og afbalancerede spisemønstre frem for strenge makronæringsstof-forhold [1]. En sund spiseplan indebærer at forstå både, hvad man skal spise, og passende portionsstørrelser [5][2]. Ved at vælge passende fødevarer kan du sigte mod at styre blodsukkerniveauet og potentielt reducere insulinresistens [3][8]. Måltider bør ideelt set indeholde en balance mellem kulhydrater, proteiner og sunde fedtstoffer [7]. Det anbefales også at reducere indtaget af mættet fedt og tilsat sukker [2].\nHer er fødevareanbefalingerne baseret på dine mål:\nTop 30 Fødevarer at Spise\nDenne liste prioriterer fødevarer kendt for deres lavere glykæmiske påvirkning, antiinflammatoriske egenskaber, næringstæthed og egnethed til en kost med moderat kødforbrug.\n1. Proteiner og Fedtstoffer:\n\nLaks: (Rig på antiinflammatoriske omega-3 fedtsyrer, højkvalitetsprotein)\nSardiner: (Fremragende kilde til omega-3, calcium og protein)\nKyllingebryst (uden skind): (Magert proteinkilde)\nKalkunbryst (uden skind): (Meget mager proteinkilde)\nÆg: (Komplet protein, indeholder cholin og sunde fedtstoffer - moderering anbefales af nogle, men generelt gavnligt)\nLinser: (Fremragende kilde til plantebaseret protein, højt fiberindhold, lavt glykæmisk indeks)\nKikærter: (God kilde til plantebaseret protein og fibre)\nTofu/Tempeh: (Alsidige plantebaserede proteinkilder, fremstillet af soja)\nAvocado: (Rig på enkeltumættede fedtsyrer, fibre, antiinflammatoriske stoffer)\nOlivenolie (Ekstra Jomfru): (Højt indhold af enkeltumættede fedtsyrer og antioxidanter, antiinflammatorisk)\nNødder (Mandler, Valnødder): (Giver sunde fedtstoffer, protein, fibre og antiinflammatoriske stoffer - portionskontrol er nødvendig)\nFrø (Chia, Hørfrø, Hamp): (Rige på fibre, omega-3 (ALA) og protein)\n\n2. Grøntsager:\n\nSpinat: (Næringstæt, lavt kalorieindhold, kilde til vitaminer og mineraler, betragtes som ikke-stivelsesholdig [4])\nGrønkål: (Højt indhold af vitamin K, A, C og antioxidanter, ikke-stivelsesholdig [4])\nBroccoli: (Rig på fibre, vitamin C, K og sulforafan med antiinflammatoriske egenskaber, ikke-stivelsesholdig [4])\nPeberfrugter (alle farver): (Højt indhold af C-vitamin og antioxidanter, lavt kalorieindhold, ikke-stivelsesholdig [4])\nBlomkål: (Alsidig, lavkulhydrat grøntsag, kilde til fibre og vitaminer, ikke-stivelsesholdig [4])\nSquash/Zucchini: (Lavt kalorieindhold, kilde til kalium og A-vitamin, ikke-stivelsesholdig [4])\nSvampe: (Indeholder B-vitaminer og selen, unikke antioxidanter, ikke-stivelsesholdige [4])\nLøg & Hvidløg: (Indeholder præbiotiske fibre og potente antiinflammatoriske stoffer)\nTomater: (Kilde til lycopen, en antioxidant med antiinflammatoriske fordele)\n\n3. Komplekse Kulhydrater og Andet:\n\nQuinoa: (Komplet protein, god kilde til fibre, fuldkorn [4])\nHavregryn (Valsede eller Steel-Cut): (Højt indhold af opløselige fibre, især beta-glucan, hjælper med at styre blodsukkeret, fuldkorn [4])\nBrune Ris: (Fuldkorn der giver fibre og næringsstoffer [4])\nBær (Blåbær, Jordbær, Hindbær): (Lavt glykæmisk indeks, højt indhold af antioxidanter og fibre)\nCitrusfrugter (Appelsiner, Grapefrugter): (God kilde til C-vitamin og fibre, kan støtte insulinfølsomheden [4])\nÆbler: (Kilde til fibre, især pektin)\nSøde Kartofler: (Kilde til fibre og vitaminer, lavere glykæmisk indeks end hvide kartofler - portionskontrol er nøglen)\nBønner (Sorte, Kidney): (Højt indhold af fibre og plantebaseret protein, lavt glykæmisk indeks)\nUrter & Krydderier (Gurkemeje, Ingefær, Kanel): (Indeholder potente antiinflammatoriske stoffer)\n\nTop 10 Fødevarer Kun at Spise i Små Mængder\nDisse fødevarer kan passe ind i en sund kost, men bør indtages moderat på grund af kalorieindhold, naturligt sukkerindhold eller potentiel påvirkning på blodsukker eller inflammation ved overdrevent indtag. Styring af portionsstørrelser er vigtigt [2][5].\n\nRødt Kød (Magre Udskæringer): (Kilde til protein, jern, B12, men højere i mættet fedt end fjerkræ/fisk og forbundet med inflammation i store mængder)\nOst: (Kilde til protein og calcium, men kan have et højt indhold af mættet fedt og natrium [2])\nFrugt med Højere Sukkerindhold (Mango, Ananas, Druer): (Giver vitaminer og fibre, men har et højere naturligt sukkerindhold)\nTørret Frugt (Rosiner, Dadler): (Koncentreret kilde til sukker og kalorier, selvom de indeholder fibre)\nKartofler (Hvide): (Stivelsesholdig grøntsag, kan hæve blodsukkeret betydeligt, hvis de spises alene eller i store portioner)\nMajs: (Stivelsesholdig grøntsag, ofte genetisk modificeret, højere glykæmisk påvirkning end ikke-stivelsesholdige grøntsager)\nHonning/Ahornsirup: (Naturlige sukkerarter, påvirker stadig blodsukkeret, brug meget sparsomt som sødemiddel)\nFuldkornsbrød/Pasta: (Bedre end raffinerede kornprodukter, men stadig forarbejdet og kan påvirke blodsukkeret - vælg 100% fuldkorn og kontroller portionerne)\nMørk Chokolade (70%+ kakao): (Indeholder antioxidanter og nogle sundhedsmæssige fordele, men også sukker og kalorier)\nNaturligt Nøddesmør: (Sunde fedtstoffer og protein, men meget kalorietæt)\n\nTop 10 Fødevarer at Undgå\nDisse fødevarer frarådes generelt, da de kan få insulinniveauet til at stige markant, fremme inflammation og tilbyde ringe ernæringsværdi. Reduktion af tilsat sukker og usunde fedtstoffer er afgørende [2].\n\nSukkerholdige Drikke (Sodavand, Sødet Te, Frugtjuice): (Højt indhold af tilsat sukker [2], forårsager hurtige blodsukkerstigninger)\nRaffinerede Kornprodukter (Hvidt Brød, Hvid Pasta, Hvide Ris): (Frataget fibre og næringsstoffer, fører til hurtige blodsukkerstigninger)\nForarbejdede Snacks (Chips, Kiks, Småkager): (Ofte højt indhold af raffinerede kulhydrater, usunde fedtstoffer, natrium [2] og tilsat sukker [2])\nForarbejdet Kød (Pølser, Hotdogs, Pålæg): (Højt indhold af natrium, konserveringsmidler og usunde fedtstoffer; forbundet med inflammation)\nFriturestegt Mad: (Højt indhold af usunde fedtstoffer, kalorier og potentielt transfedt)\nKager og Bagværk: (Typisk højt indhold af raffineret mel, sukker [2] og usunde fedtstoffer [2])\nSukkerholdige Morgenmadsprodukter: (Højt indhold af tilsat sukker [2] og raffinerede kulhydrater)\nFødevarer med Transfedt (Delvist Hydrogenerede Olier): (Stærkt forbundet med inflammation og hjertesygdomme)\nOverdreven Alkohol: (Kan forstyrre blodsukkerkontrol og bidrage med tomme kalorier)\nSaucer/Dressinger med Højt Tilsat Sukker/Natrium: (Ketchup, nogle salatdressinger, BBQ-sauce - tjek etiketterne omhyggeligt [2])\n\nHusk, dette er en generel retningslinje baseret på dine angivne mål. Individuelle behov kan variere [6][8]. At fokusere på hele, uforarbejdede fødevarer og en afbalanceret måltidssammensætning [7] vil støtte dit mål om en lav-insulin, antiinflammatorisk kost med moderat kødindtag.\nDette svar er baseret på følgende realtidsdata/oversatte koncepter:\n\nOptimale makronæringsstofforhold for forebyggelse og behandling af type 2-diabetes er kontroversielle; fokus bør i stedet være på spisemønstre og faktiske fødevarer. [1]\nReducer dit indtag af mættet (usundt) fedt og tilsat sukker, og vælg fødevarer med lavt saltindhold. At reducere portionsstørrelsen af dine måltider kan også hjælpe dig… [2]\nVed at vælge de rigtige fødevarer for dig kan du reducere din insulinresistens og hjælpe med at holde dit blodsukker i skak. Der er ingen fast kostplan for at reducere… [3]\nFødevarer, der kan støtte insulinfølsomhed, inkluderer ikke-stivelsesholdige grøntsager, fuldkorn og citrusfrugter. [4]\nLær om planlægning af afbalancerede måltider. En sund spiseplan inkluderer at vide, hvad man skal spise, og hvor meget man skal spise. To almindelige måder at planlægge måltider på er… [5]\nAt spise fra de vigtigste fødevaregrupper. Diabetisk kost. Hvor meget du skal spise og drikke, er baseret på din alder, køn, hvor aktiv du er, og de mål, du sigter mod… [6]\nMåltider og snacks bør også være afbalancerede med kulhydrater, protein og sundt fedt, da inkludering af ikke-kulhydratfødevarer i dit måltid kan hjælpe med at reducere… [7]\nDin plan vil hjælpe med at sikre, at du får den ernæring, du har brug for, samtidig med at du holder dine blodsukkerniveauer på målet. En god måltidsplan vil tage højde for… [8]"

    "section": "",
    "text": ":Model Instructions:\n\n:You: please summarize this video in detail\n\n\n\nOpenAI’s Sam Altman on Building the ‘Core AI Subscription’ for Your Life\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, here is a detailed summary of the key points discussed by Sam Altman in the Sequoia Capital interview regarding OpenAI’s vision, particularly the concept of a “Core AI Subscription”:\nOverall Vision: Building Foundational AI & AGI\n\nLong-Term Goal: Altman reiterates that OpenAI’s ultimate mission is to ensure Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. Everything they do, including current products like ChatGPT and the API, are steps towards this larger goal.\nIterative Deployment: OpenAI believes in iteratively developing and deploying increasingly powerful AI systems. This allows society to adapt gradually, provides feedback for improving models, identifies risks early, and helps shape the development of AGI safely.\n\nThe “Core AI Subscription” Concept\n\nBeyond Specific Products: Altman envisions AI becoming a fundamental utility, deeply integrated into various aspects of life and work, rather than just a collection of disparate tools or apps.\nPersonalized & Contextual: This “core subscription” would power a highly personalized AI agent. This agent would understand the user’s context, preferences, history, data (with permission), goals, and communication style.\nProactive Assistant: It wouldn’t just react to prompts but could potentially anticipate needs, manage information, automate complex workflows, and act as a true assistant or collaborator across different applications and platforms. Think of it as an intelligence layer you subscribe to.\nValue Proposition: The value would come from immense productivity gains, enhanced creativity, better decision-making, offloading cognitive load, and enabling users to do things they couldn’t before. It aims to be an indispensable tool for knowledge work and potentially many other areas.\nAnalogy: While not explicitly stated as a perfect analogy, it’s like subscribing to electricity or the internet – a foundational service that enables countless applications, but in this case, the service is personalized intelligence.\n\nPath Towards the Vision\n\nScaling is Key: Altman emphasizes the “scaling hypothesis” – the idea that making models larger, training them on more data, and using more computation continues to yield significantly better capabilities. They believe this path still has a long way to go before hitting fundamental limits.\nCompute as a Bottleneck: Access to vast amounts of computation is currently one of the biggest constraints and areas of focus for OpenAI. Building and training state-of-the-art models requires immense resources.\nModel Improvements: Continuous improvement in model architecture, training techniques, efficiency, and alignment is crucial. GPT-4 is a step, but future models (GPT-5 and beyond) are expected to be dramatically more capable.\nMaking AI Cheaper & Faster: Reducing the cost and increasing the speed of inference (running the models) is vital for widespread adoption and the feasibility of a constantly available personalized AI agent.\n\nCurrent State & Near-Term Focus\n\nGPT-4 and ChatGPT: These are showcases of current capabilities and platforms for learning about user needs and interaction patterns. They are stepping stones towards the more integrated vision.\nAPI & Ecosystem: Providing API access allows developers to build diverse applications on top of OpenAI’s models, exploring different use cases and accelerating innovation. This helps inform OpenAI about where the most value lies.\nPlugins/Integrations: Efforts like ChatGPT Plugins are early attempts to give the AI access to external tools and real-time information, moving towards a more capable agent.\n\nChallenges and Considerations\n\nSafety and Alignment: Ensuring these powerful systems are aligned with human values and intentions is paramount. This is a core research area for OpenAI.

    "section": "",
    "text": ":Model Instructions:\n\n:You: bitte fasse dieses video im detail zusammen\n\n\n\nPekings neue MACHT-Strategie wird ALLES VERÄNDERN / Die besten China-Aktien und ETF / Frank Sieren\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Okay, here is a detailed summary of the Börse Online video featuring Frank Sieren, covering the key topics and insights discussed:\nIntroduction & Main Themes:\n\nThe video features Marin Kobotsch from Börse Online interviewing China expert and author Frank Sieren.\nKey topics announced are the US-China trade conflict (Zollkonflikt), the Chinese stock market, and general insights from China, including investment opportunities (stocks and ETFs).\n\nUS-China Trade Conflict:\n\nCurrent Situation: Tariffs are extremely high (Sieren mentions over 150%). China has stated it won’t escalate further, even if the US does, leading to a stalemate. The US wants China to initiate negotiations, but Beijing refuses under the current circumstances, citing a lack of reliability from the US side.\nUS Dependence & Domestic Pressure: Sieren emphasizes US dependence on Chinese goods (citing Walmart where 80% of products are from China). Rising prices or unavailability of goods would create significant problems for Donald Trump, who was elected partly on promises of economic improvement. Trump likely knows this.\nChina’s Position & Leverage: China has systematically reduced its trade dependence on the US (now around 14%). While significant, Sieren suggests China might have more patience. However, China’s domestic economy isn’t performing strongly yet (Binnenkonsum lagging), making international deals still important. Short-term, China might have slightly more leverage as Trump initiated the conflict and faces domestic pressure.\nUnderlying Dynamics: Sieren views the conflict fundamentally as an “Abwehrkampf” (defensive struggle) of a declining power (USA) against a rising one (China). This underlying dynamic won’t change, but the approach to managing it can. He believes the “gravity towards compromise” is increasing daily due to economic interdependence.\nGlobal Context: Trump’s leverage is limited (US share of world trade ~11%). He relies on the inability of the rest of the world to unite against him (e.g., discussing potential WTO measures against the US, which has been blocking WTO judge appointments).\nFentanyl Issue: Mentioned by Trump, but Sieren considers it a side issue (“Seitental”) in the larger trade conflict.\nPath Forward: Trust and reliability are key issues. Sieren notes China’s reluctance to negotiate without perceived reliability from the US side. Potential US concessions (like temporary exemptions for chips/smartphones) are unclear due to conflicting US statements.\n\nChinese Economy & Stock Market:\n\nEconomic State: Sieren believes the economic low point has been reached, and recovery is underway, but the speed is uncertain.\nChallenges: Domestic reforms are still needed, and investor skepticism persists. Global issues (like the trade war) create high nervousness and volatility in the markets, forming an entanglement (“Monade”) where it’s hard to pinpoint causes for market moves.\nMarket Performance: The initial positive rally in Chinese markets (Hang Seng, Shanghai Composite) at the start of the year was largely erased by the trade conflict. The high volatility hinders a smooth recovery, even if underlying fundamentals improve.\n\nChina’s Strategic Response:\n\nRegional Focus: China is actively strengthening ties with its neighbors to fill the power vacuum left by the US’s inward focus. Examples include resumed high-level talks with South Korea and Japan (after 5 years) on a free trade agreement, and Xi Jinping’s visits to Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia (already major trading partners).\nInfrastructure Projects: The external pressure pushes regional cooperation. Example: The long-discussed China-Vietnam railway project (financed by an $8bn Chinese loan) is now moving forward.\nOutcome: Sieren argues that US pressure inadvertently pushes Asian countries closer together under China’s leadership, strengthening intra-Asian trade and coordination, which will ultimately support economic recovery.\n\nInvestment Opportunities in China:\n\nFocus on Innovation: Sieren stresses looking at areas where China is an innovation leader, often surpassing the West.\nElectric Vehicles (EVs): Despite a “ruinous price war,” leaders are emerging. He names Xiaomi (internationally listed), BYD, and potentially Chery (top exporter) and Geely. These companies show double-digit growth while German automakers decline in China.\nAutonomous Driving: Huawei’s HIMA system is highlighted as potentially the most advanced globally. Huawei partners with automakers (like Seris building the Aito brand, competing in the premium segment against BMW/Mercedes/Audi) rather than building its own cars. Sieren advises looking closely at these partners (e.g., Seris).\nLow Altitude Economy (Air Mobility): EHang received its operating license for autonomous 2-seater passenger drones (210kg payload), envisioning airport-to-city transport.\nInvestment Strategy: Sieren suggests a dual approach:\n\nPicking specific innovative companies (“Innovationsperlen”).\nInvesting in broad Chinese market ETFs for long-term exposure to the general Asian economic shift, acknowledging current high volatility.\n\n\nGerman Industry in China:\n\nPerception Shift: While German companies still have a good reputation generally, German cars are losing appeal among young Chinese consumers. They are increasingly seen as “cars for the over-60s,” while younger buyers prefer brands reflecting their generation. This shift happened rapidly (within ~3 years).\nChallenges for Chinese Brands in Europe: Chinese automakers expanding into Europe (like MG using price) are making mistakes similar to Western companies entering China – underestimating local needs (e.g., service network expectations). Sieren sees these as “teething problems” that will be overcome.\nEU-China Auto Negotiations: Talks are ongoing regarding potential EU tariffs on Chinese EVs. A possible outcome discussed is setting minimum prices and requiring localization in Europe, reducing direct price pressure on European manufacturers and making Chinese companies feel European costs.\n\nInternal Chinese Dynamics:\n\nGovernment & Population: The government understands the population’s desire for more influence and is finding ways (“eingruven”) to negotiate compromises within the existing system. Citizens exert power through consumption and investment decisions.\nImpact of US Pressure: External pressure tends to unify the Chinese population (“Jetzt erst recht” - Now more than ever), increasing determination to innovate and succeed. This is compared to how chip sanctions spurred domestic development. It’s driven by national pride and a refusal to be dictated to.\nProperty Market: Sieren clarifies it’s not a US-style crash but a “reform crisis” caused by tighter regulations. Some developers failed, but the situation is normalizing. Social unrest was largely avoided as local governments often completed unfinished projects. The key challenge was lack of planning certainty, which is improving. No immediate major crisis foreseen.\nTaiwan: The conflict remains stable (“neither increasing nor improving”). Sieren believes neither Beijing nor Washington currently wants escalation due to the focus on trade and the catastrophic economic consequences of a military conflict (disruption of chip supply – 60-90% of advanced chips from Taiwan – would mean the “end of the world economy”). Both sides are likely rational enough to avoid this in the near term.\n\nFrank Sieren’s Concluding Thoughts:\n\nPerception vs. Reality: Visitors to China are struck by the dynamism and “Aufbruchstimmung” (spirit of optimism/departure).\nAdvice for Germany/West: Focus more on China’s strengths, not just weaknesses. Overestimate rather than underestimate competitors. Building walls is not a sustainable economic strategy.\nCooperation: Identify areas where China leads and consider collaboration (“If you can’t beat them, join them”). Example: Renault-Geely cooperation (including engines for Mercedes).\nCall to Action: Sieren encourages visiting China (visa-free travel helps) to gain firsthand experience, which significantly impacts perception and investment perspective. He sees hints of a more cooperative approach towards the “Global South” in Germany’s coalition agreement as a potentially positive sign.\n\n\n:You: thanks, please translate your whole answer to german\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: Gerne, hier ist die detaillierte Zusammenfassung des Videos mit Frank Sieren, ins Deutsche übersetzt:\nEinleitung & Hauptthemen:\n\nDas Video zeigt Marin Kobotsch von Börse Online im Interview mit dem China-Experten und Autor Frank Sieren.\nDie angekündigten Hauptthemen sind der US-China-Handelskonflikt (Zollkonflikt), der chinesische Aktienmarkt und allgemeine Einblicke aus China, einschließlich Investitionsmöglichkeiten (Aktien und ETFs).\n\nUS-China-Handelskonflikt:\n\nAktuelle Situation: Die Zölle sind extrem hoch (Sieren erwähnt über 150 %). China hat erklärt, nicht weiter zu eskalieren, selbst wenn die USA nachlegen, was zu einer Patt-Situation führt. Die USA möchten, dass China Verhandlungen aufnimmt, aber Peking lehnt dies unter den gegenwärtigen Umständen ab und verweist auf mangelnde Verlässlichkeit der US-Seite.\nUS-Abhängigkeit & innenpolitischer Druck: Sieren betont die Abhängigkeit der USA von chinesischen Waren (er nennt Walmart, wo 80 % der Produkte aus China stammen). Steigende Preise oder Nichtverfügbarkeit von Waren würden erhebliche Probleme für Donald Trump schaffen, der teilweise aufgrund von Versprechen wirtschaftlicher Verbesserung gewählt wurde. Trump weiß das wahrscheinlich auch.\nChinas Position & Hebelwirkung: China hat seine Handelsabhängigkeit von den USA systematisch reduziert (jetzt etwa 14 %). Obwohl dies signifikant ist, deutet Sieren an, dass China möglicherweise mehr Geduld hat. Allerdings läuft Chinas Binnenwirtschaft noch nicht stark (der Binnenkonsum hinkt hinterher), was internationale Abkommen weiterhin wichtig macht. Kurzfristig könnte China einen etwas längeren Hebel haben, da Trump den Konflikt initiiert hat und innenpolitischem Druck ausgesetzt ist.\nZugrundeliegende Dynamik: Sieren betrachtet den Konflikt grundlegend als einen “Abwehrkampf” einer absteigenden Macht (USA) gegen eine aufsteigende Macht (China). Diese zugrundeliegende Dynamik wird sich nicht ändern, aber der Umgang damit kann sich ändern. Er glaubt, dass die “Schwerkraft in Richtung eines Kompromisses” aufgrund der wirtschaftlichen Verflechtung täglich zunimmt.\nGlobaler Kontext: Trumps Hebelwirkung ist begrenzt (US-Anteil am Welthandel ca. 11 %). Er verlässt sich auf die Unfähigkeit des Rests der Welt, sich gegen ihn zu vereinen (z. B. Diskussionen über mögliche WTO-Maßnahmen gegen die USA, die die Ernennung neuer WTO-Richter blockiert haben).\nFentanyl-Thema: Von Trump erwähnt, aber Sieren betrachtet es als Nebenthema (“Seitental”) im größeren Handelskonflikt.\nWeg nach vorne: Vertrauen und Verlässlichkeit sind Schlüsselfragen. Sieren weist auf Chinas Zurückhaltung hin, ohne wahrgenommene Verlässlichkeit der US-Seite zu verhandeln. Mögliche US-Zugeständnisse (wie vorübergehende Ausnahmen für Chips/Smartphones) sind aufgrund widersprüchlicher US-Aussagen unklar.\n\nChinesische Wirtschaft & Aktienmarkt:\n\nWirtschaftlicher Zustand: Sieren glaubt, der wirtschaftliche Tiefpunkt sei erreicht und eine Erholung sei im Gange, aber die Geschwindigkeit ist ungewiss.\nHerausforderungen: Innenpolitische Reformen sind noch notwendig, und die Skepsis der Investoren hält an. Globale Themen (wie der Handelskrieg) erzeugen hohe Nervosität und Volatilität an den Märkten und bilden eine Verflechtung (“Monade”), bei der es schwer ist, die Ursachen für Marktbewegungen genau zu bestimmen.\nMarktentwicklung: Die anfänglich positive Rallye an den chinesischen Märkten (Hang Seng, Shanghai Composite) zu Jahresbeginn wurde durch den Handelskonflikt weitgehend zunichte gemacht. Die hohe Volatilität behindert eine reibungslose Erholung, auch wenn sich die Fundamentaldaten verbessern.\n\nChinas strategische Antwort:\n\nRegionaler Fokus: China stärkt aktiv die Beziehungen zu seinen Nachbarn, um das Machtvakuum zu füllen, das durch den Fokus der USA auf sich selbst entsteht. Beispiele sind wieder aufgenommene Gespräche auf hoher Ebene mit Südkorea und Japan (nach 5 Jahren) über ein Freihandelsabkommen sowie Xi Jinpings Besuche in Vietnam, Malaysia und Kambodscha (bereits wichtige Handelspartner).\nInfrastrukturprojekte: Der externe Druck treibt die regionale Zusammenarbeit voran. Beispiel: Das lange diskutierte Eisenbahnprojekt zwischen China und Vietnam (finanziert durch einen chinesischen Kredit von 8 Mrd. USD) wird nun vorangetrieben.\nErgebnis: Sieren argumentiert, dass der US-Druck unbeabsichtigt die asiatischen Länder unter Chinas Führung enger zusammenrücken lässt, was den innerasiatischen Handel und die Koordination stärkt und letztendlich die wirtschaftliche Erholung unterstützen wird.\n\nInvestitionsmöglichkeiten in China:\n\nFokus auf Innovation: Sieren betont, dass man sich auf Bereiche konzentrieren sollte, in denen China ein Innovationsführer ist und den Westen oft übertrifft.\nElektrofahrzeuge (EVs): Trotz eines “ruinösen Preiskampfes” zeichnen sich führende Unternehmen ab. Er nennt Xiaomi (international gelistet), BYD und potenziell Chery (Top-Exporteur) sowie Geely. Diese Unternehmen zeigen zweistelliges Wachstum, während deutsche Autohersteller in China zurückfallen.\nAutonomes Fahren: Huaweis HIMA-System wird als potenziell das weltweit fortschrittlichste hervorgehoben. Huawei arbeitet mit Autoherstellern zusammen (wie Seris, die die Marke Aito bauen und im Premiumsegment gegen BMW/Mercedes/Audi konkurrieren), anstatt eigene Autos zu bauen. Sieren rät, diese Partner (z. B. Seris) genau zu beobachten.\nLow Altitude Economy (Luftmobilität): EHang hat die Betriebslizenz für autonome 2-sitzige Passagierdrohnen (210 kg Nutzlast) erhalten, die den Transport vom Flughafen in die Stadt ermöglichen sollen.\nInvestitionsstrategie: Sieren schlägt einen zweigleisigen Ansatz vor:\n\nAuswahl spezifischer innovativer Unternehmen (“Innovationsperlen”).\nInvestition in breit gestreute chinesische Markt-ETFs für ein langfristiges Engagement im allgemeinen asiatischen Wirtschaftsaufschwung, wobei die aktuelle hohe Volatilität berücksichtigt wird.\n\n\nDeutsche Industrie in China:\n\nWahrnehmungswandel: Obwohl deutsche Unternehmen generell immer noch einen guten Ruf haben, verlieren deutsche Autos bei jungen chinesischen Konsumenten an Attraktivität. Sie werden zunehmend als “Autos für die über 60-Jährigen” angesehen, während jüngere Käufer Marken bevorzugen, die ihre Generation widerspiegeln. Dieser Wandel geschah schnell (innerhalb von ca. 3 Jahren).\nHerausforderungen für chinesische Marken in Europa: Chinesische Autohersteller, die nach Europa expandieren (wie MG über den Preis), machen ähnliche Fehler wie westliche Unternehmen beim Eintritt in China – sie unterschätzen lokale Bedürfnisse (z. B. Erwartungen an das Servicenetz). Sieren sieht dies als “Kinderkrankheiten”, die überwunden werden.\nEU-China Auto-Verhandlungen: Gespräche über mögliche EU-Zölle auf chinesische E-Autos laufen. Ein mögliches Ergebnis ist die Festlegung von Mindestpreisen und die Forderung nach Lokalisierung in Europa, was den direkten Preisdruck auf europäische Hersteller verringert und chinesische Unternehmen die europäischen Kosten spüren lässt.\n\nInterne chinesische Dynamik:\n\nRegierung & Bevölkerung: Die Regierung versteht den Wunsch der Bevölkerung nach mehr Einfluss und findet Wege (“eingruven”), um Kompromisse innerhalb des bestehenden Systems auszuhandeln. Bürger üben Macht durch Konsum- und Investitionsentscheidungen aus.\nAuswirkungen des US-Drucks: Äußerer Druck neigt dazu, die chinesische Bevölkerung zu einen (“Jetzt erst recht”), was die Entschlossenheit zur Innovation und zum Erfolg steigert. Dies wird mit der Reaktion auf die Chip-Sanktionen verglichen, die die heimische Entwicklung anspornten. Es wird von Nationalstolz und der Weigerung, sich Vorschriften machen zu lassen, angetrieben.\nImmobilienmarkt: Sieren stellt klar, dass es sich nicht um einen Crash nach US-Muster handelt, sondern um eine “Reformkrise”, die durch strengere Regulierungen verursacht wurde. Einige Entwickler scheiterten, aber die Situation normalisiert sich. Soziale Unruhen wurden weitgehend vermieden, da lokale Regierungen oft unfertige Projekte fertigstellten. Die größte Herausforderung war die mangelnde Planungssicherheit, die sich verbessert. Keine unmittelbare größere Krise in Sicht.\nTaiwan: Der Konflikt bleibt stabil (“weder zunehmend noch besser werdend”). Sieren glaubt, dass weder Peking noch Washington derzeit eine Eskalation wollen, aufgrund des Fokus auf den Handel und der katastrophalen wirtschaftlichen Folgen eines militärischen Konflikts (Unterbrechung der Chip-Lieferketten – 60-90 % der fortschrittlichen Chips aus Taiwan – würde das “Ende der Weltwirtschaft” bedeuten). Beide Seiten sind wahrscheinlich rational genug, dies kurzfristig zu vermeiden.\n\nFrank Sierens abschließende Gedanken:\n\nWahrnehmung vs. Realität: Besucher in China sind beeindruckt von der Dynamik und “Aufbruchstimmung”.\nRatschlag für Deutschland/den Westen: Konzentrieren Sie sich mehr auf Chinas Stärken, nicht nur auf Schwächen. Überschätzen Sie Wettbewerber eher, als sie zu unterschätzen. Mauern zu bauen ist keine nachhaltige Wirtschaftsstrategie.\nKooperation: Identifizieren Sie Bereiche, in denen China führend ist, und ziehen Sie Zusammenarbeit in Betracht (“If you can’t beat them, join them”). Beispiel: Renault-Geely-Kooperation (einschließlich Motoren für Mercedes).\nHandlungsaufforderung: Sieren ermutigt dazu, China zu besuchen (visumfreies Reisen hilft), um Erfahrungen aus erster Hand zu sammeln, was die Wahrnehmung und Investitionsperspektive erheblich beeinflusst. Er sieht Andeutungen eines kooperativeren Ansatzes gegenüber dem “Globalen Süden” im deutschen Koalitionsvertrag als potenziell positives Zeichen."

    "text": ":Model Instructions:\n\n:You: please summarize this video in detail\n\n\n\nAI Became My Career Coach (Found Job, Wrote Resume, Blew My Mind) - Claude + Bright Data MCP\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17: Here is a detailed summary of the YouTube video titled “AI Became My Career Coach (Found Job, Wrote Resume, Blew My Mind) - Claude + Bright Data MCP” by Eduards Ruzga:\nThe video starts with the author, Eduards Ruzga, expressing excitement about a valuable combination of AI (Claude) and a web data scraping tool (Bright Data MCP) that he believes has the potential to significantly help viewers, particularly in surprising ways like career advising. He clarifies upfront that the video is sponsored by Bright Data, but the idea originated from his own positive experience and finding the tool genuinely valuable enough to share regardless of sponsorship.\nBackground and Motivation:\nEduards explains his frustration with paying for multiple AI tools (like Claude for coding and ChatGPT for search, deep search, and image generation). He had previously tried giving search capabilities to Claude using other methods:\n\nPuppeteer MCP: Controlling a Chrome browser to search Google - found it slow and results weren’t great compared to ChatGPT.\nFirecrawl MCP: A scraper and search company - results were still slower and lower quality than ChatGPT’s Deep Research, and it added extra cost. He had almost given up on making Claude good at web search and was resigned to paying for both Claude and ChatGPT.\n\nIntroduction to Bright Data MCP:\nA subscriber who works at Bright Data (a large-scale web data scraping and infrastructure company) introduced him to their new MCP server for Claude. Bright Data’s key capabilities highlighted are:\n\nLarge-scale scraping, bypassing CAPTCHAs and IP blocks.\nScraping data from any URL.\nUnified Search: Searching across multiple search engines (Google, Yandex, Bing).\nSpecialized Scraping: Getting specific data like Amazon products/reviews and LinkedIn profiles/company info (acknowledged as difficult data to obtain). He was initially given $10 credit to test and provide feedback.\n\nCompetitive Analysis Comparison (Claude + Bright Data vs. ChatGPT Deep Research):\nEduards decided to test Bright Data by giving Claude a prompt to do a brand sentiment, review, feature gap, and news coverage analysis for his own product, Desktop Commander, so he could accurately judge the results. He gave the same prompt to ChatGPT’s Deep Research.\n\nChatGPT: Produced a large report that read okay but pulled a lot of irrelevant data, wasn’t specific to Desktop Commander, and didn’t teach him anything new. He felt it was generic and lacked focus.\nClaude + Bright Data: Also produced a report, but it included additional sections like Competitive Landscape, SWOT analysis, and feature direction recommendations. More importantly, it pulled much more relevant and insightful information. It read comments on Medium, YouTube, and GitHub issues, which ChatGPT seemed to miss. The SWOT analysis, in particular, felt “on point” and identified real strengths, opportunities, weaknesses, and threats for his product. He shared significant parts of this report with his co-founder, unlike the ChatGPT output.\n\nThis positive experience with the competitor analysis convinced him of Bright Data’s value with Claude and led to the sponsorship proposal.\nThe “Career Coach” Revelation (Job Hunting Demo):\nLooking for a valuable topic for the sponsored video, he considered gift hunting and lead generation (using LinkedIn scraping) but landed on job hunting as having the broadest appeal. This is where he had a breakthrough experience.\n\nInput: He started a chat with Claude asking it to find information about his Medium blog, YouTube channel, and LinkedIn profile. Later, he uploaded his CV.\nAnalysis: Claude used Bright Data to scrape his online presence, summarizing his background, interests, work history (Prezi, Infogram), AI/LMS work, and developing Desktop Commander. It even pulled factual details like his YouTube subscriber count. It then proposed potential career paths based on this analysis (AI engineering leadership, AI product development, developer experience, entrepreneurship, content/education leadership).\nJob Search: He then asked Claude to find the “best job” for him, considering his location (EU) and preference for remote work, using multiple search providers. Claude searched Google, Entropic careers, and specifically focused on Hugging Face careers.\nSpecific Job Found: Claude identified a “Machine Learning Optimization Evangelist” role at Hugging Face.\nThe “Mind-Blowing” Part: Claude didn’t just find the job; it explained exactly why this specific role was a perfect fit for him, referencing his YouTube content, AI tool knowledge, and community building activities. This made him realize he was already effectively doing “AI evangelism” without labeling it as such, opening his eyes to a career path he hadn’t considered but seemed natural given his activities.\nFurther Details: Claude found the specific job page link and used Bright Data to search for salary estimates for similar roles/companies (using data from sources like Glassdoor), providing an estimated range (€80k-€120k), even though the job posting didn’t list it.\nTailored Resume Generation: Using his own tool, Desktop Commander (integrated via MCP), Claude created a tailored HTML resume specifically for the Hugging Face role. It pulled his profile picture (via search), added a professional summary explaining his fit for that specific job based on his background (AI advocate, engineer, content creator), highlighted relevant experience aligning with the evangelist role, and listed technical content/platforms. While acknowledging minor inaccuracies (mixing some online info), he emphasized the value and effectiveness of a tailored resume. He mentioned a recruiter confirmed tailoring is encouraged if accurate.\n\nTurning Flows into a Business Opportunity:\nEduards presents the job hunting flow (or the gift hunting one discussed later) as an example of a workflow that can be tested and polished with Claude+Bright Data and then productized into a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business.\n\nLow Cost: He shows his Bright Data usage dashboard, demonstrating that extensive testing and running the demos cost surprisingly little (cents).\nImplementation: He and his partner actually created a case study by building a landing page for a “Job Commander App” based on this workflow.\nTools for Business: They used Desktop Commander for “white-coding”/generating the static parts of the website. For the complex parts (forms, file uploads, payments, email communication, user data management), they used a platform called Vurise, which integrates with Stripe for payments. Vurise handles these backend complexities, preventing the need to code them from scratch or rely on AI for critical infrastructure.\nBusiness Model (Job Commander App): The service takes user input (info, links, CV uploads via Vurise), uses the Claude+Bright Data workflow to find job matches and generate tailored information/resumes, and initially involves human verification to polish the AI’s output before sending it to the user. The initial price is €30, acknowledged as high but justified by the human verification time. They plan to automate more over time to lower the price. They offer a 100% money-back guarantee if a good job match isn’t found.\n\nBright Data MCP Setup Guide:\nHe provides a step-by-step guide for installing and setting up Bright Data MCP with Claude:\n\nInstall NodeJS (if not already installed).\nGo to the Bright Data MCP GitHub repo.\nCopy the Quick Start configuration JSON snippet for Claude.\nOpen Claude’s config folder (via Settings &gt; Developer &gt; Edit Config).\nEdit the claude-desktop-config.json file.\nPaste the snippet into the mcpServers array, ensuring correct JSON formatting (commas).\nGo to the Bright Data user account page and copy an API token.\nPaste the API token into the api_key field in the config file (between the quotes).\nSave the config file and restart Claude Desktop.\nVerify in Claude’s Settings &gt; Developer that Bright Data is listed and running.\n\nGift Hunting Demo (Second Use Case):\nHe demonstrates another potential use case: finding a gift for a kinetic 6-year-old boy, asking for best gifts in 2025, using multiple search providers and checking Amazon reviews.\n\nProcess: Claude initially used its internal search, but when prompted explicitly, it used Bright Data for searches across Google, Bing, and Yandex, AND used the specialized Amazon scraper to find product information, current prices, ratings, and reviews.\nOutput: It listed recommended products with details. He then asked Claude to create a visual report as an HTML artifact within the chat, including images.\nRefinement: The initial attempt had broken images, so he asked Claude to update the artifact to include direct links to the products on Amazon, which it did successfully. He showed the resulting interactive HTML report with names, descriptions, ratings, estimated price, reviews, and Amazon links.\n\nCost Summary:\nHe revisits his Bright Data account dashboard, showing that the entire series of tests and demos throughout the day cost only about 7-8 cents, highlighting the low cost per usage flow.\nConclusion and Call to Action:\nEduards summarizes the power of combining Claude and Bright Data MCP for tasks like detailed analysis, personalized job searching, and gift hunting. He reiterates that these workflows can be tested easily and cheaply and then wrapped into a custom business using tools like Desktop Commander and Vurise. He encourages viewers to try building their own businesses on this stack (specifically mentioning the gift hunting niche is open). He concludes with a call to action to like, subscribe, comment, share the video, and support his work via Patreon, Buy Me a Coffee, GitHub, or by trying his Job Commander App service.\n\n\n\n:Model Instructions:\n:You: please summarize this video in detail\n\n:01JNZZ2YCRJES6A7SHKZH7E4RK::claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219: # Video Summary: AI as a Career Coach with Claude + Bright Data MCP\nIn this video, Eduards Ruzga demonstrates how AI tools like Claude combined with Bright Data’s MCP (Model Context Protocol) can function as a powerful career coach and research assistant.

    "text": ":Model Instructions:\n\n:You: please summarize this video in detail\n\n\n\nSam Altman “The Future of Work” and the next 12 months…\n\n\n\n:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: This video from Wes Roth summarizes key insights shared by Sam Altman at the Sequoia Capital AI Ascent event. Here’s a detailed breakdown:\n1. Generational Differences in AI Usage:\n\nWes Roth’s Observation: Younger people, lacking preconceived notions, often use new technologies more naturally and effectively.\nSam Altman’s Insight:\n\nYounger people (college-age): Use AI (specifically ChatGPT) like an “operating system.” They have complex setups, connect it to files, use intricate memorized or pasted prompts. Critically, they consult it for major life decisions, leveraging its memory and context about their lives and relationships. The “memory thing” has been a significant change.\nPeople in their 20s and 30s: Use it more like a “life advisor.”\nOlder people: Tend to use ChatGPT as a “Google replacement.”\nAltman emphasizes this is an oversimplification but highlights the trend.\n\n\n2. AI in Coding:\n\nInternal Use at OpenAI:\n\nAltman confirms AI writes “a lot” of OpenAI’s code, specifically “meaningful code” – the parts that actually matter. He dismisses lines of code as a poor metric.\n\nFuture of Coding & OpenAI’s Product:\n\nCoding is “more central to the future of OpenAI” than just another vertical application.\nVision: AI models should return entire programs or custom-rendered code, not just text or images.\nActuation: Coding will be central to how AI models “make things happen in the world,” “actuate the world,” and call APIs.\nWhile exposed through APIs, ChatGPT itself should be excellent at writing code.\n\n\n3. Value Creation in the Next 12 Months and Beyond:\n\nFundamental Drivers of Value:\n\nBuilding more infrastructure.\nDeveloping smarter models.\nCreating the “scaffolding” to integrate AI into society.\n\nPredictions (off-the-cuff):\n\n2025: “Year of agents doing work.” Coding is expected to be a dominant category here, along with a few others.\nNext Year (implies 2026): “AI discovering new stuff.” Expect AI to make large scientific discoveries or significantly assist humans in doing so. Altman believes most sustainable economic growth comes from advancing scientific knowledge and implementing it.\n2027: AI moves from the “intellectual realm to the physical world.” Robots will transition from being a curiosity to a “serious economic creator of value.”\n\n\n4. Startups vs. Big Companies in AI Innovation:\n\nAltman’s Observation: Startups are “beating the crap out of” larger companies in AI innovation, which he sees as typical for major tech revolutions.\nWhy Big Companies Lag:\n\nPeople and organizations get “incredibly stuck in their ways.”\nBureaucracy and slow decision-making (e.g., an “information security council that meets once a year” to approve applications is too slow when tech changes quarterly).\nAltman calls this “creative destruction” and why startups win.\n\nPrediction for Big Companies: A couple more years of “fighting” and pretending AI won’t reshape everything, followed by a “capitulation and a last-minute scramble,” by which time it’s often “too late,” and startups will have “blown past” them.\nAnalogy to Individuals: The generational divide in AI tool adoption (e.g., a 20-year-old vs. a 35-year-old using ChatGPT) is “unbelievable.” He likens it to the smartphone adoption, where kids adapted quickly while some older people took years for basic tasks. Companies are seen as exhibiting a similar symptom.\n\n5. Dealing with Adversity as a Founder:\n\nEmotional Toll vs. Challenge Severity: Challenges get harder and stakes get higher, but the emotional toll tends to get easier over time. Founders build resilience with each adverse event.\nThe Acute Crisis vs. The Fallout:\n\nAcute Crisis: When a big problem hits (e.g., company failing), there’s often a lot of support, adrenaline, and founders “function.”\nThe Fallout (e.g., Day 60): Altman believes the harder part is managing one’s psychology after the immediate crisis, during the “fallout” when trying to “pick up the pieces” and rebuild.\nHe notes there’s less discussion and fewer resources on navigating this post-crisis phase compared to managing the crisis itself. This rebuilding phase is an area where founders can practice and improve.\n\n\nIn essence, Sam Altman paints a picture of rapid AI evolution, where younger generations are native users, coding becomes a fundamental output of AI, and agile startups are poised to lead. He also offers a nuanced perspective on the long-term psychological aspects of founder adversity."

Focuses on explaining emerging technologies (AI, climate, biotech, robotics, computing, space) and their future impact, skipping hype and focusing on high-impact developments with commercial viability and considering both positive/negative effects. Emphasizes rigorous journalism, editing, and fact-checking.\nThe List: The “10 Breakthrough Technologies” is an annual feature started in 2001. It represents the publication’s educated predictions about technologies poised to have the most profound impact on the economy and people’s lives in the coming years. The goal is to provide a glimpse around the corner.\n\nProcess for Selecting the List\n\nIdeas are solicited from all reporters and editors based on their reporting.\nCriteria: Will it have a major effect (good or bad)? Is there a specific reason to feature it this year (acceleration, wider adoption)?\nIdeas are debated, voted on, and refined to ensure a mix of lab tech, consumer tech, deep tech, and different fields.\nThe process takes several months.\n\nHistorical Track Record (Hits & Misses)\n\nHits: Data Mining (2001), Universal Translation (2004), Intelligent Software Assistants (2009 - precursor to AI agents), Satellite Megaconstellations (5 years ago - Starlink).\nMisses: Airborne Networks (2005 - alt air traffic control), Social TV (2010), Magic Leap (2015 - AR headset), SolarCity Gigafactory (2016). Acknowledges they don’t always get it right.\n\nThe 10 Breakthrough Technologies for 2025\n\nVera Rubin Observatory: A massive new telescope in Chile (operational mid-year) with the largest digital camera ever built. It will conduct a 10-year survey (“Legacy of Space and Time”) to create the most detailed 3D map of the Milky Way and study dark matter/energy, which make up 95% of the universe but remain poorly understood.\nGenerative AI Search: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into search engines (like Google’s AI Overviews) and chatbots. Represents a major shift in how people find information online, moving towards conversational results. Caveats include potential inaccuracies (“hallucinations”) and the impact on publishers (“zero-click” searches).\nSmall Language Models (SLMs): Guest: Will Douglas Heaven (Senior AI Editor). Smaller, more focused AI models that challenge the “bigger is better” trend of LLMs. SLMs are more efficient, cheaper, use less energy, can run locally (better privacy/offline use), and can perform specific tasks as well or better than giant models. Trend: “Small is the next big thing.” Examples include smaller versions of models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.\nCattle Burping Remedies: Guest: James Temple (Senior Climate Editor). Feed supplements (like Bovaer or those using seaweed) designed to inhibit methane production during cow digestion. Addresses a major source of greenhouse gas emissions (livestock ~20% of total). Adoption depends on cost-effectiveness, ease of use, regulation, and potential secondary benefits like increased meat/milk production or carbon credits.\nRobotaxis: Guest: Matt Honan (Editor in Chief). Fully autonomous ride-hailing services are expanding rapidly beyond test zones into dozens of cities globally (US, China, Middle East). Competition is increasing (Waymo/Uber, Zoox, Tesla, Chinese companies). Advances include using generative AI for synthetic training data and developing transferable AI models for faster deployment in new cities.\nCleaner Jet Fuel (Sustainable Aviation Fuel - SAF): New methods (using captured CO2, water, and renewable electricity, or converting ethanol/waste) are scaling up production. Crucially, new policies (like the EU mandate requiring increasing percentages of SAF) are creating significant demand, driving adoption. These fuels can often be used in existing planes.\nFascinating Robots (General Purpose Robots): Moving beyond highly specialized, pre-programmed robots. Using techniques from generative AI and LLMs, robots are being trained on diverse datasets (spatial, audio, 3D maps) to learn tasks through observation and adapt to new environments and tasks more easily. Closer to versatile, adaptable robots (e.g., household prototypes).\nLong-Acting HIV Prevention Meds: Guest: Jess Hamzelou (Biotech Senior Reporter). Injectable drug (Lenacapavir) taken only once every six months for HIV prevention. Offers huge convenience over daily pills (PrEP). A trial showed 100% effectiveness. Major challenge is cost and ensuring access in low/middle-income countries, despite licensing deals for generics.\nGreen Steel: New methods to produce steel with zero or low emissions, tackling a major industrial pollution source (~10% of global CO2). Technologies involve replacing coal with hydrogen (produced using renewables) or using direct electrification. Example: H2 Green Steel plant in Sweden starting production soon. High impact potential.\nStem Cell Therapies That Work: After decades of promise, stem cell therapies are showing solid evidence of effectiveness in clinical trials. Examples include treatments for Type 1 Diabetes (creating insulin-producing cells, reducing/eliminating insulin need) and epilepsy (using engineered neurons to reduce seizures frequency). Marks a significant milestone for the field.\n\nHonorable Mentions (Considered but Didn’t Make the Cut)\n\nVirtual Power Plants: Systems managing distributed energy resources. Happening, but scale/impact not widespread enough yet.\nAI Agents: Autonomous AI performing tasks. Exciting potential, but technology is still too early, unreliable, and facing challenges.\nAir Taxis (eVTOLs): Electric vertical takeoff/landing aircraft. Progress being made, but commercial operations haven’t started yet.\n\nAudience Poll (The 11th Breakthrough)\n\nAudience invited to vote via QR code on which technology should be the “People’s Choice.”\nOptions: Brain-Computer Interfaces, Methane-Detecting Satellites, Hyperrealistic Deepfakes, Continuous Glucose Monitors.\n\nConclusion & Call to Action\n\nThe list represents educated projections, and the future can change.\nEncouragement to read MIT Technology Review for trusted insights into emerging tech (mentions “The Download” newsletter and provides QR code).\nBrief Q&A touches on impact, retrospectives on past lists, and anticipating future trends."
