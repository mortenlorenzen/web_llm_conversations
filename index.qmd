## LLM dialogues

This is my repository for noteworthy LLM dialogues, including 

- in-depth topic research
- summaries and Q&A with documents and YouTube videos


Topics include:

- AI Technology
- AI in Business
- Building Stuff (prompts, Agents, Evals, MCP's, ...)
- Investments, Global Politics



## Why? {}

> **Accelerating Knowledge Acquisition**

LLMs excel at rapidly processing and synthesizing extensive information, delivering direct answers that save us valuable time. 

However, true knowledge acquisition requires still a balanced approach â€” while AI efficiently extracts and presents data, we must still engage in thoughtful reflection, **reread the information** to do measured consideration of complex information. 

We want to transform this accelerated input into effective decision support and deeper understanding.
