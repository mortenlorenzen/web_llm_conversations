## Why? {}

**Accelerating Knowledge Acquisition and Contextual Intelligence**

LLMs excel at rapidly processing and synthesizing extensive information, delivering direct answers that save us valuable time. 

However, true knowledge acquisition requires still a balanced approach â€” while AI efficiently extracts and presents data, we must still engage in thoughtful reflection, **reread the information** to do measured consideration of complex information. 

We want to transform this accelerated input into effective decision support and deeper understanding.
