**:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:** Okay, here is a detailed summary of the Msty Studio Toolsets video:

**Introduction & Core Concept:**

*   The video introduces a powerful feature in Msty Studio called "Toolbox" (also referred to as tools or toolsets).
*   This feature allows Large Language Models (LLMs) within Msty Studio to interact with external "tools" installed on the user's machine.
*   **Crucially, this feature relies entirely on the "Sidecar" component**, which must be running and connected. The Sidecar powers the execution of these tools. (Users are urged to watch the previous video about Sidecar).
*   These tools enable communication with various external systems: data sources, file systems, GitHub repositories, web search, databases (like MySQL, SQLite), Google Drive, etc. They can provide context (like file lists or data) to the LLM and perform actions (like writing files, creating directories, executing commands).
*   The technology underpinning this is the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, developed by Anthropic (Claude's creator). Msty Studio provides an interface to leverage this protocol.

**Msty Studio's Approach & Advantages:**

*   While other applications might use MCP, Msty Studio offers a unique, browser-based approach.
*   Users don't need a separate desktop application (like Claude's official one) to manage or use these tools.
*   Configuration and management are designed to be straightforward.
*   The Sidecar can run anywhere (locally or on a remote server), allowing users to connect from the browser-based Msty Studio and access powerful tools without needing them installed directly on their local client machine.
*   **Vision for the Future:** The presenter envisions scenarios where users can create toolsets and assign them to specific users or teams (e.g., giving controlled tool access to family members like children or parents) without requiring them to manage installations, promoting accessibility.

**Limitations:**

*   Tools currently **do not work well with local LLMs**. This is presented as a limitation of the underlying models/protocols regarding streaming during tool use, not Msty Studio itself. Online models (like Claude models demonstrated) work much better.

**Setup and Configuration:**

1.  **Connect Sidecar:** Ensure the Sidecar is running. Copy its local endpoint URL and token into the Msty Studio connection settings and *save* the connection info. A successful connection is indicated by a bolt icon.
2.  **Access Toolbox:** Navigate to the "Toolbox" section in Msty Studio.
3.  **Adding Tools:**
    *   **Import Default Tools:** Msty Studio provides an option to import a set of pre-defined common tools to get started (e.g., Search, File System, Git, GitHub, Mac OS commands).
    *   **Disclaimer:** Msty does *not* provide, maintain, or support these tools. Users add and run them at their own risk. Msty cannot help with setting up specific tool dependencies or arguments beyond the platform integration.
    *   **Manual Addition:** Users can add their own tools by finding MCP server configurations (often available on GitHub in official or community repositories like "awesome-mcp-servers"). This involves providing a Tool ID, optionally an icon, and the tool's JSON configuration (specifying command, arguments, placeholders, environment variables).
    *   **Dependencies:** Most tools require dependencies like Node.js, Python (often with package managers like `npx` or `uv`), or Docker. The Toolbox interface shows required dependencies and indicates if they are detected via the Sidecar connection (showing red if missing or disconnected).
4.  **Tool Parameters:**
    *   Individual tools can have *default parameters* set (e.g., a default API key for Brave search, default host/port/user for MySQL).
5.  **Creating Toolsets:**
    *   This is a key concept. Users create named "Toolsets," which are *collections* of one or more tools configured for a specific purpose. This is similar to "Knowledge Stacks" in the Msty App.
    *   Within a specific Toolset, users can *override* the default parameters of a tool or provide specific ones needed only for that toolset (e.g., setting a specific `allowed_directory` for the File System tool, or providing production database credentials for a MySQL tool in one toolset and development credentials in another).
    *   Toolsets can be reordered to set preference if multiple toolsets containing similar tools are selected.

**Demonstration:**

*   The presenter connects the Sidecar.
*   Imports the default tools.
*   Shows the configuration details for tools like MySQL, demonstrating how to add default parameters (host, port, user).
*   Creates multiple Toolsets:
    *   One combining MySQL and Google Search.
    *   One for "Prod MySQL" with specific overridden parameters (host, password, database name).
*   Demonstrates creating a custom tool ("my own SQL") by copying JSON configuration from an online source and defining placeholders for arguments and environment variables.
*   **Main Demo (Mac OS & File System):**
    *   Creates toolsets: `Mac OS info` (using a Mac OS tool) and `Mac OS FS tool` (combining Mac OS and File System tools).
    *   Selects the `Mac OS info` toolset and uses an online Claude model to ask about the Mac's CPU and disk information. The LLM successfully uses the tool via Sidecar to retrieve this system info.
    *   Configures the `Mac OS FS tool` toolset, specifically setting the `allowed_directories` parameter for the File System tool to point to a local documentation folder.
    *   Selects the `Mac OS FS tool` toolset.
    *   Asks the LLM what files/folders it can see in the configured directory. It correctly lists them.
    *   Asks the LLM to create a new directory ("demo") within the allowed path. The directory is successfully created on the file system.
    *   Asks the LLM to write the CPU information (obtained via the Mac OS tool) into a file `cpu.txt` within the `demo` directory (handled by the File System tool). This demonstrates combining multiple tools within a conversation flow.

**Summary & Conclusion:**

*   Toolbox is a feature for integrating external tools using Sidecar and MCP.
*   Users can manage tools, set default parameters, and create specific "Toolsets" by combining tools and overriding parameters for specific tasks.
*   Requires Sidecar and works best with online models.
*   Msty Studio provides the platform but not the tools themselves.
*   Msty Studio remains browser-based with local data storage.
*   The presenter mentions a forthcoming "Live Context" feature to be shown in the next video.

**:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:** Okay, here is a detailed summary of the Msty Studio Sidecar video:

**Introduction & Purpose of Sidecar**

*   The video introduces "Sidecar," described as an optional but very important feature for Msty Studio.
*   **Msty Studio Context:** Msty Studio is a web application that runs in a browser on various devices. While flexible, being a web app means it operates within a browser sandbox, limiting its ability to access local machine resources, run commands, or directly fetch certain external data (like YouTube transcripts) due to security restrictions (e.g., CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
*   **Sidecar's Role:** Sidecar acts as a "helper app" or a small, dedicated backend for Msty Studio. It's a separate application installed and run on a user's desktop machine (Windows, Linux, Mac) or potentially a remote server.
*   **Why Needed:** It bridges the gap between the limited web environment of Msty Studio and the capabilities of a local machine, enabling features that Msty Studio alone cannot perform.
*   **Optionality:** Msty Studio functions without Sidecar, but specific advanced features are only activated when Sidecar is running and connected.

**How Sidecar Works & Setup**

*   **Installation:** Users download and install the Sidecar application on a chosen machine.
*   **Interface:** Currently shown as a menubar application (not a full chat interface). It provides options to manage the Sidecar service.
*   **Connection Details:**
    *   **Local Endpoint:** Provides a local network address (URL) for Msty Studio to connect to.
    *   **Token:** A security token is required for Msty Studio to authenticate with Sidecar. This token can be copied from the Sidecar menu.
    *   **Regenerate Token:** Tokens are regenerated each time Sidecar starts for security.
    *   **Quit:** Option to stop the Sidecar service.
*   **Connecting from Msty Studio:**
    *   Users go to the connection settings in Msty Studio.
    *   They input the Sidecar's endpoint URL and the current authentication token.
    *   There's an option to save the connection info (though the token needs updating if Sidecar restarts).

**Security Features**

*   **Authentication:** Connection requires a valid, current token.
*   **Token Regeneration:** Tokens change on restart, preventing unauthorized use of old tokens.
*   **Domain Restriction (CORS Hardcoding):** Sidecar will be hardcoded to *only* accept connections from the official Msty Studio domain (e.g., `mystudio.com`). Random websites cannot connect to it.
*   **HTTPS:** Connections are expected to use HTTPS for security.
*   **User Control:** The user must explicitly run the Sidecar application.

**Tunneling Feature**

*   **Problem:** To connect to Sidecar from a different device (like a phone or iPad) not on the same local network, the `localhost` or local IP address isn't sufficient.
*   **Solution:** Sidecar includes an optional "Tunneling" feature.
*   **Mechanism:** When enabled, it uses Cloudflare's tunneling service to create a secure (HTTPS), public URL that forwards traffic to the local Sidecar instance.
*   **Benefit:** Makes it easy for users (even non-technical ones) to access Sidecar's features from any device, anywhere, without complex network configuration.
*   **Security Note:** This involves routing traffic through Cloudflare; users who prefer not to can keep tunneling disabled. Connection still requires the token and is restricted by domain.

**Demonstrated Functionality: YouTube Transcripts**

*   **Challenge:** Web applications like Msty Studio typically cannot directly fetch YouTube transcripts due to browser security and CORS policies enforced by YouTube.
*   **Sidecar Solution:** Msty Studio delegates the task to Sidecar. Sidecar, running as a local application, is not bound by the browser's sandbox and can fetch the webpage and extract the transcript data.
*   **Demo:** The presenter adds a YouTube video URL as an attachment in Msty Studio. Sidecar (connected) fetches the transcript in the background. The presenter then successfully chats with the video's content ("Summarize this for me"), proving the transcript was retrieved and used as context.

**Future Potential & Vision**

*   **Local AI Integration:** A major future plan is to embed local AI services like Ollama directly within Sidecar. This would allow users to run local AI models accessible via Msty Studio without needing separate complex setups. Msty Studio might even manage models through Sidecar.
*   **Service-Based:** Sidecar might evolve from a UI application to a background service, suitable for running on servers without a graphical interface.
*   **More Powerful Features:** The presenter emphasizes that Sidecar enables many powerful features, and more capabilities will be added and demonstrated over time (e.g., potentially improved real-time data fetching, though web search scraping is noted as fragile).
*   **Stability:** Sidecar itself is envisioned as a relatively stable component that won't require frequent updates, unlike a desktop application.

**Msty Studio vs. Msty App Clarification & Licensing**

*   The presenter explicitly clarifies that **Msty Studio (the web app)** is a completely **different application** from the existing **Msty App (the desktop application)**. While some features overlap, they serve different purposes (web/mobile/team access for Studio vs. desktop power for App).
*   **Licensing Bonus:** As a gesture, users with an Orum license for the Msty App desktop application will be granted access to Msty Studio as well (limited to one activation to prevent misuse).

In essence, Sidecar is a crucial companion app for Msty Studio, overcoming web application limitations to unlock advanced features like local resource access, external data fetching (YouTube transcripts), and future capabilities like integrated local AI, all while maintaining security through tokens and domain restrictions.

**:Model Instructions:** 

  
**:You:** please summarize this video in detail

[![Msty Studio - Local AI with Sidecar](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1NGtXhoACn4/maxresdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCIAKENAF8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGGUgZShlMA8=&rs=AOn4CLBsi9lXUENtZe7aCOV-JOGXXxdxtg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NGtXhoACn4)

**:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:** Okay, here is a detailed summary of the YouTube video "Msty Studio - Local AI with Sidecar":

**Core Problem & Msty Studio's Goal:**
The video addresses concerns from users that Msty Studio (a web-based application for interacting with large language models) might make using *local* AI models difficult, especially for newcomers. The presenter aims to demonstrate that Msty Studio, particularly with its companion app "Sidecar," actually *simplifies* the process of setting up and using local AI.

**Msty Studio Basics (Web App):**
*   Msty Studio itself is a web application, meaning users don't need to install anything to use it *if* they are connecting to online AI providers like OpenAI, OpenRouter, etc. This makes it easy for teams, classrooms, or individuals to try LLMs without installation hurdles.

**Introducing Sidecar (for Local AI):**
*   For users who *do* want to run AI models locally on their own hardware, Msty provides a separate downloadable application called "Sidecar."
*   Sidecar is presented as the recommended starting point for anyone new to local AI who wants to use it with Msty Studio. It guides users through the setup process.

**Sidecar First-Run Demonstration:**
1.  **Initial Launch:** When a new user runs Sidecar for the first time, it presents setup options for local AI.
2.  **Setup Options:**
    *   It detects if the user already has models from the standalone Msty App or Ollama installed and offers to use those.
    *   Crucially, it offers to "Set up local AI." The presenter chooses this option.
3.  **Automated Setup:** Sidecar then automatically handles the download and configuration of the necessary components to run local AI. It sets this up as an isolated instance, even if the user has other local AI setups (like the Msty App), ensuring it runs on its own port without conflict.
4.  **Connecting to Msty Studio:** Once the setup is complete, Sidecar provides options:
    *   Copy the local AI endpoint URL (for manual configuration).
    *   A button labeled "Start using in Msty Studio," which is highlighted as the convenient option for new users.
5.  **Seamless Integration:** Clicking the button automatically opens Msty Studio in the web browser and connects it to the local AI endpoint managed by Sidecar. The presenter demonstrates this by immediately starting a chat with the default local model.

**Beyond Setup: Model Management via Msty Studio:**
*   The video emphasizes that Sidecar's utility extends beyond the initial setup. Msty Studio's "Model Hub" feature leverages the connection established by Sidecar (or any compatible endpoint) for managing models.
*   **Connecting to Providers:** In the Model Hub, users first select the AI provider they want to manage. In the demo, this is the local AI instance set up by Sidecar. The presenter notes you could also add and manage *remote* AI endpoints (e.g., a powerful server elsewhere) through this interface.
*   **Managing Models:** Once connected to a provider (like the local Sidecar one), users can:
    *   **Install Featured Models:** Browse and install curated models (e.g., Gemma 3, TinyLlama).
    *   **View Installed Models:** See a list of all models currently available on that endpoint.
    *   **Install Ollama Models:** Search and install models directly from the Ollama library (demonstrated with Llama 3.2).
    *   **Install Hugging Face Models:** Mentioned as a capability (search and install).
    *   **Install Custom Ollama Models:** Paste the name/tag of any model from Ollama Hub (demonstrated with `codellama:7b-instruct-fp16`) to download and install it.
    *   **Monitor Downloads:** A progress indicator shows active downloads, which can be paused and resumed.

**Clarification on Sidecar Necessity:**
*   While Sidecar provides the easiest *setup* experience, the presenter clarifies that you *don't* strictly need Sidecar running just to *manage models* in the Model Hub. Any Ollama-compatible endpoint (including one run by the standalone Msty App or Ollama itself) can be added and managed through Msty Studio's Model Hub.

**Upcoming Feature: Local AI Settings Management:**
*   A future feature teased is the ability to manage the *settings* of the local AI server directly from Msty Studio (e.g., restart the server, configure CORS headers, add authentication).
*   **Crucially, this upcoming settings management feature *will* require Sidecar** to be installed and running, as the web app itself cannot directly modify local server configurations without it.

**Conclusion:**
The video concludes by reiterating that Sidecar makes getting started with local AI in Msty Studio very easy, aligning with their priority of user-friendliness, especially for newcomers. It provides a guided setup and enables powerful model management features directly within the Msty Studio web interface, with further local server controls planned that will leverage Sidecar.

**:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:** Okay, here is a detailed summary of the Msty Studio - Turnstiles YouTube video:

**Introduction & Core Concept**

*   The video introduces "Turnstiles," presented as arguably the most advanced and powerful feature in Msty Studio to date.
*   At its core, Turnstiles allow users to queue multiple messages (prompts) and have them sent to the AI model in sequence.
*   The speaker emphasizes that while basic queuing exists in other apps, Msty Studio's implementation goes much further, particularly through the composition of "add-ons."

**Basic Queuing & Management**

1.  **Adding Messages:**
    *   Users can type a message and click the "Turnstile" icon (or use Alt+Click on the icon) to add it to the queue.
    *   Example: Adding "Hi," then "hello," then "tell me something interesting."
2.  **Running the Queue:** Clicking "Run" sends the messages sequentially. The AI responds to each message before the next one is sent.
3.  **Alternative Input (Syntax):**
    *   Users can define multiple messages directly in the input box using `---m` as a separator between messages.
    *   Example: `Hi ---m hello ---m tell me something interesting`
4.  **Queue Management UI:**
    *   Once messages are in the queue (visible in a side panel), users can:
        *   **Reorder:** Drag and drop messages to change the sequence.
        *   **Skip:** Toggle a switch to skip specific messages during execution.

**Advanced Queue Commands (Syntax-based)**

*   Special syntax can be used at the end of a multi-message input block:
    *   `---r [number]`: Regenerate the *last* message in the sequence `[number]` additional times. (Example: `---r 2` means the last message runs, then regenerates twice more, for a total of 3 executions of that step). This mimics the standard regenerate function but within the sequence.
    *   `---c [number]`: Continue the generation for the *last* message `[number]` times. This is useful if a response gets cut off due to token limits. (Example: `---c 4` with a low max token limit shows the AI continuing its thought over multiple calls).
*   **State Snapshot:** When a message is added to the queue (either via UI or syntax), it takes a snapshot of the current settings (selected model, parameters like max tokens, temperature, etc.) for that specific step.

**Saving & Loading Turnstiles**

*   Users can save the current queue configuration (including all steps and their individual settings) as a named "Turnstile."
*   Saved Turnstiles can be loaded later, even in different chat sessions, repopulating the queue exactly as it was saved.
*   This allows users to reuse complex sequences easily.

**Advanced Turnstile Editing & Add-on Composition (The Core Power)**

*   A dedicated Turnstile management UI allows detailed editing of saved Turnstiles.
*   **Per-Step Customization:** The key power lies in customizing *each individual step* within the Turnstile sequence independently. For each step, users can:
    *   Select a different AI model.
    *   Change parameters (temperature, tokens, etc.).
    *   Enable/disable attachments (documents, YouTube links).
    *   Enable/disable real-time web data access.
    *   Add specific Toolsets.
    *   Enable/disable Live Context.
*   This allows for highly complex workflows, like using one step for research with web access, another step for summarization with a different model, and a third step for creative writing.

**Integrating Personas**

*   Personas (pre-defined agent configurations in Msty Studio) can be added as steps *within* a Turnstile sequence.
*   Example: A Turnstile asks an AI about an interesting animal, and the *next* step in the Turnstile is a "Poet" persona tasked with writing a poem about the animal described in the previous step's response.
*   This further enhances the composability, as Personas themselves can have unique models, tools, system prompts, etc.

**Looping/Repeating Turnstiles**

*   A small `#` icon in the Turnstile queue panel allows users to set a number.
*   This number dictates how many times the *entire* Turnstile sequence will run in a loop.
*   Example: A 2-step Turnstile set to run 5 times will execute Step 1 -> Step 2 -> Step 1 -> Step 2... for a total of 5 full cycles.
*   **Warning:** The speaker explicitly warns that this feature can be powerful but potentially very expensive (in terms of API costs), especially when complex add-ons or many steps are involved. It's presented as a "chainsaw" – powerful but requires caution. The feature is slightly hidden by default (set to run once).

**Export & Import**

*   Turnstiles, including all their steps, configurations, and even attached files, can be exported and imported, allowing users to share complex workflows.

**Conclusion**

The Turnstiles feature transforms Msty Studio from a simple chat interface into a powerful automation and workflow tool, allowing users to sequence AI interactions, customize each step with various add-ons (models, tools, data sources, personas), save/load these sequences, and even loop them for repeated tasks. The emphasis is on the composability and flexibility offered by this system.

**:You:** please summarize this video in detail

[![Private searches in Msty Studio using SearXNG](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/FFDSy3TX3YI/maxresdefault.webp)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFDSy3TX3YI)

---

**:01JR0E39PYK7YKH4FBR4W00CMV::gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:** Okay, here is a detailed summary of the YouTube video "Private searches in Msty Studio using SearXNG":

**Introduction & Problem:**

The video introduces a new feature in Msty Studio: the ability to use SearXNG as a real-time data search provider. This aligns with the Msty ecosystem's focus on privacy, as SearXNG allows users to have full control over their search mechanism, keeping searches private. The presenter notes the potential ambiguity in pronouncing "SearXNG" (suggesting "Searx-N-G" based on its origin as a fork of Searx with "NG" for Next Generation).

**Setup Options & Focus:**

There are two main ways to set up SearXNG: installing it locally or hosting it on a server. The video focuses on the second option: setting up SearXNG on a user-owned server and connecting it to Msty Studio. A disclaimer is given that the video won't cover every detail of provisioning a Virtual Private Server (VPS) or installing all base dependencies, directing viewers to the official SearXNG documentation (docs.searxng.org) for more comprehensive installation guides.

**Installation Method & Tools:**

*   The presenter recommends using Docker for installation, citing issues encountered with the standard installation script (specifically around Redis installation on Ubuntu) at the time of recording.
*   Key prerequisites for the server setup are Docker and a web server like Nginx (especially for enabling HTTPS/SSL).
*   The presenter briefly mentions using a server management tool called "Cleaver" and a VPS provider like "Vultr" to quickly provision a server with necessary components like Docker, Nginx, and SSL pre-configured. The SearXNG instance is configured to listen on port 8080.

**SearXNG Installation via Docker (Terminal Steps):**

The presenter demonstrates the setup process via a terminal connected to the provisioned server, closely following the SearXNG Docker documentation:

1.  Adds a new user (`searxng`).
2.  Changes directory (`cd`) into the user's directory.
3.  Sets the export port variable (`export PORT=8080`).
4.  Pulls the SearXNG Docker project/image.
5.  Runs the SearXNG Docker container using commands copied from the documentation.
6.  Verifies the container is running using `docker ps`.

**SearXNG Configuration:**

After installation, specific configuration changes are needed within the `settings.yml` file located in the SearXNG directory (likely mounted from the container):

1.  **Enable JSON Format:**
    *   The presenter first demonstrates (using `curl` command from the server's terminal) that requesting search results with `format=json` initially results in a `403 Forbidden` error because JSON output is disabled by default. Removing the format parameter returns HTML successfully.
    *   To fix this, the `settings.yml` file is edited (using `vim`). Under the `search:` section, within `formats:`, `json` is added to the list alongside `html`.
2.  **Configure CORS Headers:**
    *   To prevent Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors when Msty Studio tries to query the SearXNG instance from the browser, specific HTTP headers need to be added in `settings.yml` (likely under a `server:` section's header settings).
    *   The presenter adds three `Access-Control-Allow-*` headers:
        *   `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: Specifically mentioning `misty.studio` (and potentially others like the server's own domain).
        *   `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`: Allowing `GET, POST, OPTIONS`.
        *   `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`: Allowing `Content-Type, X-Requested-With`.
    *   It's emphasized that without these CORS settings, the integration will fail.
3.  **Restart Container:** After saving changes to `settings.yml`, the Docker container needs to be restarted using `docker container restart <container_id>`.
4.  **Verification:** The presenter re-runs the `curl` command requesting JSON format (`format=json`) and confirms that it now successfully returns search results in JSON format instead of the 403 error.

**Integration with Msty Studio:**

1.  The presenter copies the HTTPS URL of their hosted SearXNG instance.
2.  Back in Msty Studio, they right-click the "real-time data globe" icon.
3.  They select the "Use SearXNG" option.
4.  They paste the copied SearXNG instance URL into the provided endpoint field.

**Testing the Integration:**

1.  A question requiring real-time data is asked within Msty Studio.
2.  A response is successfully received.
3.  The real-time data sources listed in the response are expanded, confirming that results were fetched via the configured SearXNG instance.

**Conclusion:**

The video concludes by confirming that the setup is successful. Users can now leverage their private, self-hosted SearXNG instance for real-time data searches within Msty Studio, enhancing privacy and control.
