**:01JNZZ2YCRJES6A7SHKZH7E4RK::claude-3-5-sonnet-latest:** Based on the video, here are the key ways Andrej Karpathy uses LLMs:

1. Knowledge-Based Queries
- Uses LLMs for general knowledge questions, but only when the information is likely to be well-represented in the training data
- Verifies important information from primary sources
- Avoids asking about very recent events due to knowledge cutoff dates

2. Document Analysis & Reading
- Uploads documents, papers, and book chapters to analyze with LLMs
- Uses LLMs as reading companions to improve comprehension and retention
- Particularly helpful for technical papers or historical texts outside his expertise
- Always starts with requesting a summary before diving deeper

3. Code Development
- Uses specialized coding environments like Cursor (with Claude 3.7) rather than general chat interfaces
- Employs "vibe coding" where he gives high-level commands to the AI and lets it handle implementation details
- Uses LLMs for debugging and understanding code issues

4. Language Learning
- Created custom GPTs for language learning (especially Korean)
- Uses LLMs for detailed translations and vocabulary extraction
- Analyzes screenshots of subtitles from foreign content

5. Data Analysis
- Uses ChatGPT's Advanced Data Analysis for creating visualizations and analyzing data
- Carefully verifies the code and results as he considers the LLM a "junior analyst"

6. Voice Interface
- Uses voice input for about 50% of his queries on desktop (using tools like Super Whisper)
- Increases to about 80% voice usage on mobile devices
- Uses voice when the query is simple and doesn't require precise technical terms

7. Research and Deep Dives
- Uses the deep research feature for comprehensive analysis of topics
- Often consults multiple LLMs (his "LLM Council") for important questions
- Values features like memory and custom instructions to personalize interactions

8. Professional Workflow
- Pays for premium tiers of multiple LLM services to access the most capable models
- Regularly starts new chats to keep context windows clean and focused
- Carefully chooses which model to use based on the specific task requirements

9. Tool Integration
- Leverages LLMs with various tools (Python interpreter, search capability, etc.)
- Uses different LLMs for their unique strengths (e.g., Perplexity for search, Claude for artifacts)
- Combines multiple modalities (text, voice, images) as needed

The overall pattern shows that Andrej uses LLMs as sophisticated tools integrated into his daily workflow, while maintaining awareness of their limitations and verifying important information through other sources.
